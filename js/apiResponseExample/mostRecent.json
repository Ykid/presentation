The blow up feature is nice if your trying to fit small notes or edit a current note. Wish I could really fine tune how small I want my my writing to be. 0.5 Increments is still pretty good.  The only other thing is, I would like a a bit of a tutorial on how to use some of the options. Like the laser pointer feature or why I can’t write while the screen is full screen. Also wish it was smoother when making a new page.",

I am an artist and own the Apple Pencil but most of my note taking is done via keyboard and textboxes. To input notes, I take a small portion of the screen and zoom into it. However, when the keyboard appears, the screen moves to the middle of the document? You can no longer see what is going on. Especially if you are in putting text boxes near the bottom if the screen. It's annoying. I wish this app would give a work space similar to procreate, where you could zoom in and out of any corner of the page.\n\nAlso, the straight line function is no longer disability or shaky hand friendly. For various reasons,I cannot draw in a straight line or make perfect circles, blocks, etc. The straight line function was great because it didn't matter how shaky my hands and body got, it would be a straight line. It was a really stable app. But now GoodNotes 5 no longer corrects lines as strictly. Sometimes it corrects lines, other times it doesn't. Maybe they assume I'm drawing or am purposefully making obscure lines and shapes. But I'm not. GoodNotes was once a great option for assistive tech but not anymore. Please give people the option for strict line correction.",

It doesn’t matter how my palm is or how much I reset the palm detection feature, it keeps popping up.  I even try to write so that my palm isn’t touching the screen.  It’s getting to be very frustrating because it stops me mid sentence.  If this can be removed it would be perfect because then I can take my notes without interruption.",

So, I purchased this app as soon as I got my iPad and I love the organization of it but almost hate using it entirely because of the lagging. I probably would not have purchased this app if I would have known it lagged this bad. Seriously it is terrible. And it pixelates when zooming really bad and takes forever to focus.  I hear GoodNotes 4 is better, but I just don’t see spending more money on a older version. Can this please be fixed? While using this app in the middle of typing or writing the app will just close out on me. It’s pretty ridiculous. Other than this one complaint I love it. But this one complaint is enough to make me not want to use it at all and would not recommend it to others. If this could be fixed I would give 5 stars and shout it from the rooftops that this app is amazing. \n\nI hope the developer can get this fixed soon.",

But overall, if it fails to automatically update and have those saved files be compatible with multiple cloud storage services, then what is the point? I’m a student and things happen. I can’t rely on one cloud and I won’t do it. Also, a recording feature would be lovely! These two things are the only things tempting me to Notability, but I don’t want to change apps so please, fix this!",
