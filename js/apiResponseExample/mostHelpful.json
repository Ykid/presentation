I either have to carefully scroll vertically so that I don’t accidentally move it horizontally, or I need to re-center the file. I think it is better that you can only move it horizontally or vertically at one time instead of being able to move it freely in any direction (or make it as a option).",

However, the UI update lacks a dark mode, which I would have loved, and think should be standard. True GN 4 didn’t have one either, but the omission with this update makes me have little faith that the company will move the app in a direction that would benefit me, especially with the dropped Dropbox support. \n\nThe app still seems fine on its own, which is why this review is not 1-star, but as an update to my go-to note taking and pdf markup app, this update disappointed me immensely. It dropped a key feature I care about, and did not add a dark mode, which I think should be a standard option in all modern apps. \n\nAt the very least it was free for me to try as a previous GN 4 owner/user.",

I hate how they moved the color changer AND the undo button from the zoom. Whenever I open the app it takes max 5 minutes for all my notes to sync... and a college student doesn’t have time to wait that long sometimes! I ended up just deleting 5, and going back to 4. Once it’s been out for a good while, and the bugs/glitches are fixed then maybe I’ll give it another try... in the meantime, I’ll stick with GoodNotes 4 💖",

Second, if you want to convert your handwriting to text, you can only save it to another app. You can't save it in GoodNotes. That's crazy. Third, there is no word wrap around images.

Something I don’t really like is how the sizes changed, because I was already used to how they used to be. My pen was always on 2 but now I have it at 0.5mm. The overall user interface looks better.

The app can’t distinguish between my fingers and a stylus, and it’s a struggle to move to the next page simply, the app wants to leave a pen mark. \n\n2. Backup feature doesn’t work. I keep getting an error that says operation couldn’t be completed. GoodNotes export error0\n\n3. I have to use different types of paper for the notes that I take, and when changing the paper template, it’s unresponsive \n\n4. It randomly writes on the notebook when I lean my palm on the screen, and it’s so frustrating especially when y trying to listen to a lecture \n\nThere are so many bugs with this app, and I strongly recommend to wait until they are all addressed before downloading.",

I’ve updated to 5.05 and I’m still experiencing many of the same glitches. I will update my review as soon as they fix these terrible malfunctions.",

          "label": "I used Goodnotes 4 almost everyday for college. Although the new features are great in Goodnotes 5, the main core component of writing is very very very buggy. Goodnotes 4 was PERFECTLY AND I MEAN PERFECTLY SMOOTH. I had no problems with writing and erasing and the overall quality of the interface. Goodnotes 5 has none of that quality so far. The smoothness is not there. Goodnotes 4 actually felt like i was writing on paper. In 5 its the random bugs that ruin it. For example, sometime the eraser stops working or the writing disappears after writing a sentence so i have to write it again. These bugs need to be fixed ASAP!",

Please take a look at those two functions for the app, and I am pretty sure a lot of people will appreciate it",

This app does the trick by maintaining a beautiful organization for my content that follows my directed customizations rather than cookie-cutter functionality. \n\nWhat I notice about GoodNotes is that the tools it does include are done with much attention to detail and are executable by anyone. With another popular app, there’s all of the features, but none of them are cohesive or provide needed precision for detailed annotation. Love being able to write freely and draw wherever with GoodNotes. Love notebook visual customizations. Love being able to include PDF docs in my notebook....\n\nONLY thing I want to see is a perfected set of pen tools (with more variations in brushstroke).\n\nGOOD WORK, team!",
