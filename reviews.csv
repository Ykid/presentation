5016693553,Missing Crucial Features,Sunny해,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id532346922,5.3.7,2,"Missing Features Present in Older Version:
- Zoom window shortcuts
- Automatic Google Drive backup

What I miss from GoodNotes4 are:
- Quicker menu system (drop down list; no flashy transitions/animations when moving between folders)
- Smaller file sizes on Cloud. I moved files to GoodNotes5 and once they synced to Apple Cloud, these files took more space on Cloud than they did while on GoodNotes4.. it’s strange.

What I do like about GoodNotes5:
+ Dark mode
+ Ability to bring up multiple notebooks at a time",0

The side scroller doesn’t work so it’s really annoying. There needs to be a better way to type so that it actually stays in the lines, just adding a text box isn’t enough for when I’m taking notes in class.",0

5011745110,Poor Customer Service “Capta” Garbage & Poor Ability to Convert to Text,Loathes Advertising,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id184125643,5.3.7,1,"DO NOT BUY APP

I obtained this app to convert handwritten notes into text for my case notes.  I expected to be able to do that efficiently, ie an entire document at a time.  The “lasso” is too cumbersome. 

I tried repeatedly to contact “Support,” but all contact is refused without “Capta” which is NOT visible on iPad or iPhone. I expect easy responsive “Support” contact, not calculated intentional impediments.  How do I obtain a refund?

My question:  “Is there a single button, selection etc to convert an entire document at one time?”  If not, I would not have bought the app.

Unless and until these impediments are corrected, DO NOT BUY APP!",0

I was changing the page backround from wide ruled to blank and it shifted all my words down about a quarter of the way. Well the bottom most part of the page was pushed out of the page and now the words I had there are now gone and I thought I could go back and fix it after I changed all my pages to blank backround. Well I came Back to the first page and there is no way to get back those words so now each page is just missing a quarter of my notes and I needed those to study for my classes. This is extremely saddening to see my stuff just disappear. A,0

i really don’t want to lose data and icloud storage for uploading large pdfs and ebooks...
- add voice recording option
- bring back the good features of good notes 4 (color change option in writing mode for example)

It cannot create decent shapes from drawings and has no ability to add a shape that is well drawn. It has a bug that causes the iPad to be unable to focus the camera when adding photos directly.

5007588040,Appreciate the ability to convert written scripts to text,CARCONWILMOR,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id603587759,5.3.7,4,"I have recently had a stroke and since typing is a frustrating impossibility at this time I had hoped my Apple Pencil could enable me to efficiently express my written thoughts.  As far as I can tell, good notes is the only app with this feature.  I appreciate it, but wish it could be a little more seamless- where maybe a “conversion text box” could just do it automatically, instead of going through the write-lasso-convert-copy-paste sequence.  To that matter, I wish the Apple pages supported this ability, but since they don’t I’m thankful for good notes!",0

Of course there are shape and straight line tools which is awesome. But as a student, whenever I am doing math and need to divide a line into multiple points of centimetres with x and y axis, I have no other way available than the straight line tool and assume the points in the line.

Wish you could press a button and have pre-defined type in consistently the same positon for a page label and just type it and move on.

The issue is that there are some bugs that are unacceptable. Sometimes the notes just disappear when I go to move them, and then after a few minutes they’ll reappear after I attempted to write over them. There is no use in a notes app that cannot record critical notes quickly. I have a new iPad 6 so there should be no hardware incompatibility.",0

I use this app to upload various documents for my job and uploading 1 at a time is too time consuming. Version 4 allows for multiple documents to be uploaded at one time so it’s odd that this feature did not carry over to version 5, at least as of October 2019.

I would love it if undo was only a single two finger tap instead of two...Like every other app. When I transition from pencil to tapping to undo, the first two taps seem to be ignored anyhow so I need to tap four times to undo once. Very annoying.
