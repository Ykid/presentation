3786251738,Please bring these features back!,mylikeyourlove,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id207792389,5.0.12,5,"This app really does move forward in the right direction, but I was so disappointed to see that the palm rest feature and the ability to name the bookmarks are gone. I rely on these features heavily because I use this GoodNotes as my sole note taking app. 
I’ve also noticed that the app will often turn pages blank if you delete some pages in an upload. When I upload PDFs or power-points, I can’t delete any of those pages without running the risk of them turning into blanks. The same occurs with pictures. I can no longer drag and drop in pictures, because they will disappear completely. The only way to avoid this is by saving the photos I’ve selected in my camera roll. Only, then do the images stay. There is a glitch when deleting pages. After about 20 or so pages, the app scrolls away from the current location and will not return to its former place. This is a bit frustrating when deleting multiple pages.
There is also a difference in lagging between the newest iPad version released in November 2018 and the version released much earlier in the year. I found it much harder to work on my 12.9 than my 10.5.
The upgrades are amazing and I would like to see a voice recording function. A drag and select feature for deleting or exporting, or the ability to be able to delete/export by page numbers like you would for printing from a computer. These would be cool, but I’d MUCH rather have these problems fixed before adding new features.",18
3854685036,Good notes 4 performs better than Good notes 5,Firstviceroy,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id35421569,5.0.20,5,"I am writing this review to help the developers and potential buyers. First I’m providing this review in March 2019. Things may change later so if you are reading this review you should keep the date and version number in mind. 5.0.20. 
We are a large builder which use Blue beam, Procore, “go to meeting” and other related industry software. We found that Good notes 4 was simply the best vehicle for note taking and plan markups available. It truly was a “five star app”. We could be on a “go to meeting” with 15 consultants on a conference call and annotate plans instantly. (What I mean is hand write changes on the pdf plans to give direction. Not edit DWG drawings.) It was fast easy and simple. Superior to other products out there, even the industry specific ones.
Now, with Good notes 5 the layout and folder structure have been improved. But, there is a big problem. If we open a set of plans and try to zoom in, the plans pixelate. Plus take an in ordinate amount of time to gain focus. Thus, most of us have stopped using this program. I have Good notes 4 and have gone back to it. I. Don’t know. If the developer is aware or working on a fix but it was a great program. If the developer is aware hope you can fix. I will check the App Store for updates.  Will mark as 2.5 stars and revise rating if able to remedy problem. Good luck.",8
4222140019,Best App Out There for Writing & Drawing with Apple Pencil ESPECIALLY,jsherrer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id767591543,5.1.1,5,"I downloaded several different apps that were free for note taking and or drawing in notebooks, etc. After not being satisfied with any of them, I decided to pay for this one. It is so worth the price! You can easily organize notes and notebooks while customizing them for whatever you need! The Apple Pencil works flawlessly as if you are using real pen and paper. I use the 1st Edition Apple Pencil with my 2019 iPad. One of the best things about this app is the fact that you can set it so that it does not capture anything from your hand or palm resting on the screen and allows you to still use your fingers to zoom, scroll through, and navigate the app all while still connected to the Apple Pencil. Also, it can literally READ and SEARCH your own handwriting so you can find where you left a certain note on a page. I have found that it this feature is very accurate! You can also customize your notebook covers, create outlines for easy navigation throughout a notebook, and you can create folders to organize each notebook even further. My only suggestion to the developers is to make it easier to get different templates for pages/covers and also allow those pages to have more background colors than just yellow or white.",6
4144070721,Makes Doing Work a Pleasure!,Kem 86437,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id531366423,5.0.32,5,"Thank you GoodNotes! Since I’m an old person of 35 years - it took a few college student vlogs and some practice before I could really get to appreciate all that this app can do...but that little bit of time was SO WORTH IT! Your app rocks. YOU HAVE BROUGHT JOY BACK INTO MY WORK LIFE! Seriously though, I’m enthusiastic but not sarcastic on this point. I work with boring documents/sit in LONG meetings (that go on for days on end) and have to take copious notes...and thanks to GoodNotes I can be efficient&creative while having fun highlighting my documents with rainbows of any colour I like, and taking notes that are both fun to write&read afterwards, as well as pack maximum info/images into a single page...plus, my past life of piles of notepads and sticky notes has been left in the dust where it belongs. THANK you for saving my shoulder from breaking off with a stupid/heavy briefcase, and for making me smile while I create the most beautiful notes I’ve ever taken of some of the most boring subjects I’ve ever had to keep awake and pay attention too. GoodNotes has probably played a significant role in my ability to excel at my job (and maintaining my sanity whiles getting it done). Cheers!",0
4919287486,"love it,  but a couple concerns",nanagiwa,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id919346450,5.3.3,4,"Love the app, convenient for college and holds a lot of storage, I wish moving around pages could be easier. And the ball pen seems too stiff, fountain pen is a little awkward to use, and the brush pen is fine, but again the pens are something I need to get used to. I wish the eraser marks could have an option to be smaller, and not erase a whole line but exactly what my pen touches. So pens are not as fluid as it could be and may make your handwriting either better or worse. Zoom ins are great and resizing also never pixelates my writing, which I LOVE. I never write reviews, so I hope the concerns I listed will be considered and that this review helps those deciding whether or not to use the app. I wish I could download it to my computer without paying extra so that I can see both on my iPad and computer. For an app meant for taking and saving notes, it is an easy and great app to use, but pens are hard to get used to.

If you are a high school student, digital note taking is okay, but it honestly isn’t necessary and teachers and classmates usually feel weird about it. In university this app is perfect since in my classes there is a lack of space for desks and so many places to walk to so the portability of a tablet is more useful then (this app also allows for split screen which is convenient)",0
4941910950,Zoom window functions!,Jennuine GoodNotes Customer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id3971045,5.3.3,3,"I like all the added features, and i sincerely appreciate the infinite folders and sub folders feature, but what happened to multifunctional tool bar in the zoom window!? It’s missing the other buttons from the original toolbar in the zoom window. I’ve owned GoodNotes ever since it was first released, thus, I am very fluent in navigating the app. I have recommended it to everyone I know, and have gone completely paperless because of it. I am eternally grateful to GoodNotes. But with this new update, I really needed the zoom window tool bar before it was even added to the first GoodNotes, and it has been a dream come true ever since it was added, but now it has been taken away in Goodnotes 5. I really hope the toolbar is reinstalled soon. The undo and redo buttons, and the three colors and the eraser were all apart of the zoom window, and much more convenient than reaching to the top of the screen every time I had to undo a pen stroke. I don’t even want to consider using GoodNotes until the zoom window is copied from GoodNotes 4. While it may seem like a silly feature, it made the app 100% more useful to me. I hope this is taken into account and an easy fix to to release soon. 
Thank you, 
Your original customer

Also, your textboxes are very persnickety and glitchy, please, please fix!",0
4711672404,"Please fix the zoom function, moving screen, and straight lines",Taisaacs95,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id483861824,5.2,1,"The ""automatic zoom"" feature is turned off but I still have this issue where the screen moves while using the text box function and keyboard.

I don't see very well and I cannot write for very long. I am an artist and own the Apple Pencil but most of my note taking is done via keyboard and textboxes. To input notes, I take a small portion of the screen and zoom into it. However, when the keyboard appears, the screen moves to the middle of the document? You can no longer see what is going on. Especially if you are in putting text boxes near the bottom if the screen. It's annoying. I wish this app would give a work space similar to procreate, where you could zoom in and out of any corner of the page.

Also, the straight line function is no longer disability or shaky hand friendly. For various reasons,I cannot draw in a straight line or make perfect circles, blocks, etc. The straight line function was great because it didn't matter how shaky my hands and body got, it would be a straight line. It was a really stable app. But now GoodNotes 5 no longer corrects lines as strictly. Sometimes it corrects lines, other times it doesn't. Maybe they assume I'm drawing or am purposefully making obscure lines and shapes. But I'm not. GoodNotes was once a great option for assistive tech but not anymore. Please give people the option for strict line correction.",0
4187504513,Love Hate relationship,Dfman762,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id470420951,5.1,1,"I am a big time user of GoodNotes. As a student i spend about half my day on goodnotes every day for the past 2 years. I absolutely love the app. I waited a really long time for the 2 major updates that came earlier this year. Those are the universal search tool as well as the introduction of unlimited hierarchy. I am a major fan of both updates and they both make my use of the app much more productive.
With that being said the ease of use with the new app has gone significantly down since the update. At first i thought with in 2 to 3 weeks they would work out the kinks and bring it back to standard but its been 4 months now and it hasn’t happened. One thing i sorely miss are the keyboard shortcuts that used to be available in GoodNotes 4. They are gone from GoodNotes 5 and have never been replaced. Besides for that the “smoothness” of GoodNotes 5 has just never been the same as 4. The crashes and just plain unstable use that haunted the app at launch are for the most part gone and the app can now be relied upon again for every day use however i still use 4 as much as i can because it is just so much nicer to use than 5.
I really hope the developers continue to work on bringing GoodNotes 5 back to the standard of GoodNotes 4. The two big updates are a major addition and if the rest of the app comes back to the level of 4 there will be no app that can compete in this AppStore.",1
3661325830,"Excellent Search Improvements, Backup options limited",powerwriter8,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id18220413,5.0.1,4,"I have been using Goodnotes for extensive note taking during graduate school. Version 5 keeps many of the aspects that have made it my favorite note taking app, but again this version is not quite perfect. The best improvement from version 4 is the document search feature, which includes your handwriting. I also enjoy the continuous scroll feature. Thank you, developers! On the downside, version 5 does not seem to have the diverse backup options that were available in version 4. I had been using Dropbox since I work on many devices that are not made by Apple, and I liked to be able to access the up to date backup from anywhere. Now, however, iCloud is the only backup option. Please make the other cloud sync services available. One feature that was carried over without change from version 4 but I hope to see updated in version 5 is the 3 size eraser. You can make the pen very fine to write small (which I love), but you can’t make the eraser very small to make fine tuned corrections. A few more small eraser options are needed. I would also like to see version 5 create an option to open 2 notes side by side (similar to the feature in Notability).",8
3682040625,Meh,Shanester95,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id168858464,5.0.3,5,"I think I will stick to GoodNotes 4. It’s not a bad update and it looks nice. I am sure I would get used to the layout after using it a but but some things are gone and new things that are highly requested aren’t here yet. There is a place for outlines in the thumbnail view in a document but I can make a new outline. When I imported my notebook from 4 I had bookmarks that aren’t there anymore. The bookmarks have changed to favorites which show up as thumbnails and I need them as the outline list like in 4 but can’t add that now. If I unfavorites something that was named from 4, it doesn’t allow me to rename it. This app still doesn’t have a way to add hyperlinks attached to texts or shapes or strokes are whatever, to other pages in the document which I really need. So I guess add hyperlink ability (if there are already hyperlinks in the document you import, you can still use them if you turn on touch mode, but you can’t add any new ones), fix the bookmarks/outlines/favorites situation to work the way it should, and then just to be picky, why does the view change when I go into touch mode... I don’t like that either. Make it like in 4 where it doesn’t change anything in the view",0
4818706920,"Great app for students, or everyone. Would be nice if there was an option for black paper.",VictoriaSilvis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id516531961,5.2.3,5,"Hey developers of GoodNotes, I’ve downloaded your app for note taking and educational purposes. I’ve been using it for a little while and I began to fall in love with GoodNotes for note taking. The features that caught my eye is personalizing your own notebook covers, and using your Apple Pencil to flawlessly take notes with palm rejection, and pressure sensitivity. 

Pressure sensitivity and palm rejection is a big deal for me, which is why I have the Apple Pencil. What I would love to see is color options for paper such as black paper, and I’d love to sometimes remember those days of using a black board for chalk and write everything down. It would be nice if you add bunch of colors including black for taking unique, and odd looking notes. 

And overall, Goodnotes is just getting better with students or people going paperless by using their cloud storage of choice for importing their notes, and data, and being able to help the environment by using less paper using the iPad. I’m glad you made this app and hoping you keep this app going on as you make more future updates.",0
3661548508,It’s OKAY.,Kirbsley,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id531104468,5.0.1,1,"So. The new Goodnotes 5 is OKAY. I actually really don’t like it. It has some new features that I do like and enjoy but, I prefer the older Goodnotes 4. 
Firstly, it seems to me that the sensitivity or the palm rejection on this version isn’t as good as the 4. Every time I am writing my page moves or “jumps” and I never experienced that with the older version. Also, the beloved Zoom box is TERRIBLE on this version. I use the zoom box all the time on the GN4 - it zooms in perfectly so I can write my notes neat and the transparent “blue box” carries on to next space on the sentence so I don’t lose my spot while I’m writing and then, continues down perfectly to next sentence. On GN5 it does not do that. Instead, of moving over to the next space of the sentence, it jumps down to other sentences and I have a whole gap of space on my current sentence. It also sometimes, jumps down a few spaces or will even move on to the next or previous page! 
I honestly feel like the newer version has too many bugs and I can’t enjoy it at all considering the fact that I do appreciate some of the newer feature like the folders, the ability to erase just the highlighter, the new page and cover options, and the pen options. 
I’m also really disappointed about the lack of the ability to view multiple documents simultaneously or side by side. 
Just an over all disappointment. I will continue using GN4 for my note-taking.",15
3711077907,"I like the new features, but there are lots of bugs.",lordbeautifulzoey,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id437363025,5.0.6,2,"As someone who loved GoodNotes 4, I was very excited for the transition over to number 5. First, I must start off by saying that I really enjoy the new formatting and some of the new features they’ve added such as being able to move text around with the lasso tool or adding the Insert a Picture feature right on the tool bar. But, I’ve noticed a lot of bugs since transitioning; the app crashes on me several times a day and no matter what I set the palm rejection sensitivity to, it still confuses my palm with my fingers. For example, if I use the zoom in text box feature while writing and it suggests a new place to start, as soon as I lay my hand back down to begin writing, it mistakes my palm as my fingers and moves the screen around causing many random scribbles and not legible letters. I use this app primarily for journaling and note taking which makes it inconvenient when the app shuts down or interferes with my writing. Additionally, the vertical page scrolling is still very glitchy even though the newest update was supposedly supposed to fix that. I’ve added too many things to GoodNotes 5 to convert back so I guess I just have to wait until they fix all the bugs. Like I mentioned, the new features are nice, but they don’t outweigh the cons. Shouldn’t have transitioned over.",6
3728934300,GoodNotes 5 is Improving Significantly,NesPro54,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id270156138,5.0.7,5,"Since mid-January, Goodnotes 5 have been getting updates consistently. Now it is almost flawless. 

Goodnotes 5 is definitely better than Goodnotes 4 --> The management of files is the biggest winner for me. Now I can organize my files depending on projects or topics using the unlimited multiple folder structures. Now I use it exclusively, whereas before I was using Notability and Goodnotes 4 depending on my goals. If I was reviewing engineering plans (page size: 22""x34""), sketches (page size: not letter sized), or reviewing large files with bookmarks, then I was using Goodnotes 4. If I wanted a quick and short note (less than 5 pages), then I was using Notability due to the vertical scrolling; but Goodnotes 5 supports this feature now. 

Goodnotes 5 really shines with the bookmarks, supporting different page sizes, vertical scrolling, and now the management of files. Still waiting: I""m looking forward to get Goodnotes 5 on my Mac and eventually seeing two notes at the same time when using my iPad. The latter is less of an inconvenience for me because I'm usually working with my Mac and iPad at the same time.  Goodnotes 5 on my Mac is a must.",2
4914860873,My favorite notes app with just one downside,Zadron Xion,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1061544856,5.3.3,5,"There are only two decent notes app for iPad out there: Notability and GoodNotes. Both have everything that a notes app should have but both have also have a single downside that is pretty much the only deciding factor for which one would prefer. GoodNotes can only sync to iCloud and does not sync to any other cloud service but Notability can sync to a multitude of cloud services. I chose GoodNotes over Notability because Notability is messy with its file system. In Notability, you cannot put folders within folders which is really annoying because it makes it impossible to sort out my notes by semester, subject, hw or lecture, etc. With GoodNotes I can sort out and organize my notes using folders within folders which is far more important than being able to have it automatically sync to Google Drive. If this app could sync to Google Drive, I would give it 5 stars. There are also a few very minor bugs too but they don’t really hinder me whatsoever so I’m not complaining. Great app! Make it possible to sync with Google Drive and this will by far be better than Notability!",0
3670182114,A Great Upgrade,kobster66,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id167384953,5.0.2,5,"Upgraded from GoodNotes 4. I read the other reviews before updating and noticed someone said their Apple Pencil lags. I haven’t had any issues with this app. The file organizer makes things better. The biggest improvement for me is having the pages scroll vertically instead of horizontally. I like being able to choose the type of pen and the fact that the hi lighter can automatically hi light a perfect horizontal line. The look is updated and more modern. The search function works well. I’ve had no issues and will definitely be using this over GoodNotes 4. I like that they added more paper styles but still no engineering paper unfortunately. 

That being said, there still are some features from OneNote that I would like to see. When importing photos, OneNote allows you to define the 4 corners you want, and it will straighten the image which is useful if you took a picture from an angle. OneNote then can turn the photo into black and white with increased contrast similar to a PDF scanning app. OneNote is also a bit better at adding typed text and gives a lot of options similar to Word, whereas GoodNotes is more basic.",3
3817325212,Missing goodies from 4,EmkayNYC,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38852228,5.0.15,3,"*Latest update: thanks for adding the custom outlines feature this is a BIG help. The one thing it does need is the ability to delete old outline items (some of my documents imported with outlines that I didn’t create and don’t want. I can’t find a way to remove them and they clutter the flow of my intended outline.  The Mac app remains a highly desired item. If these two items are added this app gets a 5 from me. 

Prior review:
Hi - big fan of Goodnotes 4 but the two glaring holes for me  in that version were 1) an easy way to reorder pdfs in large batches (I solved this by getting the Mac app which was great) and 2) nested folders.  GN 5 has the nested folders which is great but now the ability to create an outline of text bookmarks has been removed so you just see images of your favorite pages.  I used to use the favorites feature as a Table of Contents but now I can’t so now organizing very large documents is much more difficult. Would be great if you could add functionality to create / edit an outline in the app.  Also need a GN 5 version for the mac.  If you solve these two issues it gets a 4 stars from me.  5 needs to get the ink a bit more responsive like GN 4.  For some reason theres a little lag now on occasion which is distracting.",2
3714948998,Should have waited to release!,SebastianTaylor808,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id399541113,5.0.7,2,"Hi, I’m an avid GoodNotes user, I also supply it to my employees throughout my businesses.  I will continue to supply Goodnotes 4, however, I will not be offering Goodnotes 5.  In the first day of use, the Goodnotes 5 app crashed 14 times.  For someone who spends at least 6 to 8 hrs a day using your app (Goodnotes 4), I was utterly disappointed in Goodnotes 5.  Sure the features are great, when you aren’t having to reboot the app or redo your work every ten minutes.   I genuinely don’t understand how as our society moves into the future, that pride, workmanship, and quality go out the door.  I’m not singling Goodnotes out, it’s happening across the board.  I would have rather this app come out in 6 months without the bugs.  Neither Goodnotes or consumers should put up with this idea that we should just accept technologies errors, and allow it to further stress out or complicate our lives, when its job is to do the exact opposite.  The quality has to be the priority, not the rush to beat the competition, or the rush to market to boost earnings reports.  If you make a quality product that’s reliable for the long term, your product will stand alone.  Be the Goodnotes Ive grown to love, not the subpar crap everyone else is.

I use this app for EVERYTHING --from school notes to my digital Planner to diy beauty recipes to artwork and hand lettering practice. I have tried many different programs (Notability is good, but I don't care for the handwriting I produce and the style of the nib;  I love INKredible for the nib, but it doesn't do much else; Procreate does some amazing things but it's extremely feature-heavy and doesn't offer typing which is a big bummer for creating planner printables ; and probably 5-10. Other apps that were so un-noteworthy i. Can't even remember them by name) but goodnotes is the one I always come back to.

3752167467,FIRST NOTETAKING APP....IT'S ALRIGHT (ipad pro 2018),-XelaAlex-,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id399343458,5.0.8,3,"I bought the bundle for goodnotes 4&5 and I've gotten use to only using goodnotes 5. Folders is really useful and keeps all my school stuff organized. Note taking with the apple pencil is great. For the most part this app has been efficient. However, page scrolling is really laggy and is not as fluid, even with just moving around the same page. You cant move images selected with the lasso between pages. You have to cut it/copy just to get it to a different page, which is kinda silly. You can't import multiple documents at once so that's a bit annoying. I would really love to see the ability to customize the toolbar to remove/add functions in order to better fit our own needs. Plus assigning more pens/colors than the three provided would be nice, instead of switching back and forth between pens and then colors, it'd be nice to be able to switch from a ball pen red, to a fountain pen green, with just one click, so having extra presets is on my wishlist. The shape tool definitely needs A LOT of improvement, very buggy, I'm pretty sure my crappy circles are not supposed to be squares. overall it's a good app, haven't tried notability but I got this for the highlighter, it's better than notability.",2
4855317087,Excellent iPados app with one severe flaw,BarryMG,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id17895882,5.3.1,3,"I teach at university, and have multiple requirements from a note taking app. I have been an extensive user of Notability, but, with the advent of drop-and-drag multitasking in iPadOS I’ve been playing with both the new Apple “notes” app and GoodNotes. In particular, I’ve been testing how well these apps handle the transfer of drag and drop data between split screens. 
GoodNotes handles handwritten and pen-written notes fluidly, and allows the most flexibility in resizing drag and dropped images, text manipulation and the like. However, one glaring flaw (unless I’m missing something) is the inability to import URL’s with a hyperlink using GoodNotes. Yes, you can drag the link as text into the app. But, to open the link, you need to select the text box, copy the url, and paste it into the browser window. Compare this to “notes” ability to convert a dragged link into a thumb window in the note that automatically opens the url in the browser window when clicked on in the note. Even Notability will import a hyperlink into a note, albeit using a rather clumsy “import url” tab and multiple steps. In today’s world, this seems like a rather glaring omission.
Fix this in GoodNotes and, IMHO, it’ll be the leader of the pack !

3655107931,Still so far behind the others...,HeresMyTwoCents,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id112799560,5.0.1,2,"Just bought version 5, installed it, opened it, tested it, and the only thing I could say was, “Really... that’s it??!!” I should have just kept version 4. I stopped using GoodNotes a long time ago after I saw all the added features Noteshelf 2 provides, but have been hoping that GoodNotes would catch up. Sadly, they still haven’t.

It’s mind-boggling that even after all these years, GoodNotes STILL doesn’t provide dark paper to give a less glaring screen to write on. Geez, dark mode is everywhere these days, and after using it on all my apps, I hate looking at an all white screen background now. This is one main reason I switched to Noteshelf 2  They offer beautiful black and muted black papers that make writing and sketching an absolute pleasure.

GoodNotes 5 has added some glitter from version 4, but just read all the reviews from even their most loyal customers, and you’ll see that everyone is pretty fed up with the ongoing lack of features. So once again, it’s goodbye to GoodNote. Enjoy my $5.99 that I just gave you for nothing. Hopefully you’ll actually put it towards developing some features your customers are actually asking for! I’ll keep the app on my iPad and keep watching what new features are released. But I sure won’t be holding my breath!",2

GoodNotes is a truly wonderful app for organizing and note taking, my college courses would be incomplete without it! This is everything I wanted when the app first launched, so happy.

Previous- For the past couple weeks I’ve been having a lot of problems with lag on GoodNotes but no other apps, I’ve updated my iPad, changed the nib on my Apple Pencil and redownloaded the app, I’ve tried everything to get this app to work again the way it did before but it’s just incredibly frustrating to work with now. 
I don’t want to switch note taking apps because this one was so amazing but for now I’ll be taking notes in class with old fashioned pen and paper.

3726910484,Couple bugs overshadowing the otherwise great app,Tiffany Batiste,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42262967,5.0.7,2,"I’ve been a long time GoodNotes supporter and would like to continue this support, but a couple of annoying bugs need to be addressed first:
1. The app randomly returns to page 1 in the document, regularly. While reading, I suddenly find myself back at page 1 and I have no idea how or why. Super frustrating. 
2. No longer supports different pens for different documents. I used to be able to switch between documents - highlighting in one while taking notes in the other. Now, if you’re highlighting in one, the highlighter remains selected across all documents and you must manually switch back to pen (or whatever you were using in the other document) as you switch back and forth. Small feature, but very helpful when doing school work and research. 
3. Highlighting feature not quite intuitive enough. I love that the highlighter now auto creates a straight line, but it’s not quite intuitive enough to always understand when it needs to be straight. If on a bumpy surface (riding the train or in a car), there’s no way to force a straight line out of the wavy mess that inevitably ensues. 
Fixing these practical bugs would go a long way towards enabling continued support of this great platform!",0

I am constantly blown away by what you can do on GoodNotes 4 and now GoodNotes 5. I am definitely someone who prefers to write vs type most of the time and this helps to bridge my need for that but keeping everything digitally based. I feel so much better knowing I can just open this app on either my iPad or iPhone and using iCloud, sync my thoughts where I might be.

One thing I would absolutely love to see is a bit more integration with the keyboard however. I know I mentioned that I like to write vs type most times, but when I am on the go and only have access to my phone, the keyboard steals the show. I love creating lists and having a bullet point option would just be the icing on the cake. Then when I get home or have access to my iPad with the pencil, I can either rewrite my notes or simply just continue with the typed bullet list that I have now created.

Thank you for making a wonderful app and I can’t wait to see what is added next for all of us to efficiently take notes.",0

It has been a huge asset to me in organizing all of my lectures and notes for school.  When GoodNotes 5 came out I was excited to try it.  I immediately upgraded and went to class. They changed a lot in this upgrade.  It is a completely different program and in my opinion it lost some of its functionality and became more complicated to use.  Many of the features I loved were either very different or not there at all.  When I tried to look up where they went it said that they were working on adding that functionality to this new upgrade.  Importing became quite a hassle with the new setup.  I still love the app but it was just a huge learning curve to adjust to the upgrade.  I hope that they are able to bring more of the functionality back to the app quickly.

Now a year later, there is still a lot of issues.  I’m probably going to find a better app to use because I don’t have time to keep trying to make this app work.",0

I create templates IN Goodnotes and then screenshot it to make a template, and this feature becomes much more complex when you need to upload that image to Google Drive, make sure it’s in the correct folder, and make sure you know the name (because there are no image previews of the documents), AND make sure that the Drive you’re linked to is the correct Gmail account. It’s disappointing, and a tad annoying, but I have faith this will improve in time.

My biggest beef is with Google Drive. I had to reset my iPad recently, and I was relying on my Google Drive back up to provide a mostly-seamless transition into GN5, but I have yet to see a feature where I can back up my documents to the Drive. I am anxiously awaiting that time when I can do that once again - mainly because I have little way to back up my documents until then.",1

So glad I did.  I haven’t experienced any of the glitches some other folks are mentioning.  I am using it on a new iPad Pro 11” and new Apple Pencil.  The new folder system is exactly what I was wanting.  Previously I had taken all these notes but none of the apps had a good way to organize them logically.  This new update is exactly what I needed for my digital notebook.  I have now exported all of my old notes from Notability and Noteshelf to GoodNotes 5 and I have them organized like I have always wanted.

The hyperlinks unique to Goodnotes are not working in previous documents, and all the bookmarks that I had named are gone.  But the real heartbreak is that, for example, my 2019 Planner - when it downloaded it into 5, it quit - because it keeps closing - and now has lost everything past January 7!!!  It synced it back to the cloud like that, so it’s gone.  I actually feel sick.  I cannot believe my beloved Goodnotes did this.

Images. You have the option to insert an image from the app, but this means the image always becomes a new page rather than part of the page you are on. I know that you can multi-task use the drag and drop feature, but this is problematic for a few reasons. For example, it would mean having to google an image that is exactly like the one I have in front of me. Or take an image, save it to my camera roll, and use the multitasking feature on the iPad to drag and drop the image. While this admittedly not a big problem as it can be easily circumvented, it would be SO nice if I didn’t have to do that and I could simply have the option of inserting the image as a page or into the page.

The palm rejection seems to be way more sensitive then normal because writing on the left and center is fine, but when I reach the ride side it just keeps moving. The zoom feature (blue box) also keeps jumping way further then before (at least 2 lines down) and skips before reaching the right side of the page. Second there seems to be more glitches...for ex. when I would try to erase nothing would happen and instead the ink starts to glitch. Exiting out of the app does not help and I have to wait at least 5 mins before returning. Also I hate that the undo/redo feature is not a part of the zoom box like on goodnotes 4. Sometimes when I have to click undo at the top the screen returns to the first page (when in vertical view) and it’s extremely annoying.

I have the 2019 iPad Pro 11 inch and the gen 2 Apple Pencil and together with GoodNotes it is absolutely amazing. They have a very clever mechanism for allowing you take notes on lined paper where you have a little section that is blown up and when you get to the end of the zoomed in area it projects a ghosted image of the next space on the left of the writing area. It Is hard to describe in text but in practice it is really convenient and stays out of the way. I am a software engineer who uses a ton of whiteboards to keep track of ideas and concepts for both work and personal projects. GoodNotes allows me to be able to have multiple notebooks for different subjects, plot out UML and logic flow diagrams, and even offer dot grid paper (most of these apps don’t).

I got a new iPad purely for the pen and note taking / brain storming I wanted to do with it. After about three sessions of playing with GoodNotes and finally understanding all of the features, and going out there and testing out every other notes app I could find, I realized this is the best one out there.

The interface just works, and it makes sense. The analog to pen and paper is great - and better than other apps where you have to do a lot of “clicking” to add handwritten text in a separate screen, and then it imports as a picture. GoodNotes works like I would EXPECT it to work.

What held me up at first was not being able to move around notes that I had written. Today I realized what the dotted line tool in the toolbar was, and figured out how it worked. And then suddenly all my needs were met.

Only thing that is slightly annoying to me is that I had a small drawing with a lot of pen strokes in it, and selecting and moving / scaling that drawing took an extra second or two to select - assuming because of all of the data that was in the sketch. But its definitely not a show stopper.

I would also like the ability to load in my own notebook covers, but really, I’m scraping to try to find something wrong with an otherwise perfect app.

I have used GoodNotes from the early days, for 4+ years exclusively as my note taking app. The upgrade to GoodNotes4 was a great step in the right direction and I have been quite happy with it. With the upgrade to GoodNotes5, however, some basic but essential features have gone missing. I appreciate the nested folder structure and the more sleek icons, but what happened to backup to cloud services? Restricting to iClouds is a downgrade in service and versatility. It also became quite painful while writing in the magnifier window to always have to reach all the way to the top of the page to select the eraser or different colors or undo/redo or use other tools and switch back to writing with the pencil. These features were shown on the magnifier window itself in GoodNote4 and are essential to an efficient and smooth note taking experience. Once I hit this barrier, I just stopped using the new app and went back to GoodNotes4 since it's not worth my time to discover the remaining deficiencies in the app design.

I'm a sophomore in college studying computer engineering. For my purposes Goodnotes does a great job of serving as a notebook for all of my classes. I don't think it's that different from other note taking products, but I find it much simple and clean than other apps with similar purposes. Goodnotes 5 is a great improvement and I really like the new UI and quality of life improvements. There are still some bugs, but for the most part they are extremely minor from my experience and Im confident they will be resolved during the software developmwnt process. 

ISSUE: If anything my only issue is that there have been times when I have experienced severe lag whenever I am taking more intensive notes where Im covering the majority of my page.

The undo/redo buttons have been removed from the zoomed window so if you are writing this way you have to reach up to the top of the screen every time you make a mistake. Same with being able to switch between pen, eraser, and highlighter from this zoomed window. I also dislike that your pen stays the same color when you change tabs- in version 4 whatever color you were last using on a document was still selected when you went back to it. When you import a PDF with images in it, you can no longer press down on the image to copy it- like if I want to move an image from an e-textbook to my notebook. There is also a big bug- when I import some of my files to the app from google drive, the images disappear (these same files open normally in version 4).

There were quite a few bugs and lag all over the place, but after a few weeks and patches, we finally got a great app. I would say ignore the reviews regarding performance from only on because this app is great at the moment. I love how we can now scroll vertically and the new folder system makes organization better than on GoodNotes 4. Also the new resize feature is incredibly helpful. If you’re a student like me, then this app is also great for your textbooks. It makes it easy to annotate on textbooks and it has the outline of the textbooks, so that you can you any chapter easily, which is a feature not every note taking app has. If GoodNotes 5 can get recording like Notability, then I believe it would be the best note taking app hands down.

I really like that we can make outlines within notebooks, import pdfs, and a lot of other documents.

Something I would like to see is more customizable paper colors and being able to add margins, as many as we’d like. This will allow for one to make a structure of note taking more consistent. These margins could be movable, would remain the same across one note book, and be transparent, in the sense that if we were to print this paper the margin wouldn’t print. Also, though there are ways to create ones custom cover page, I would appreciate it if we didn’t have to circumvent the current way to apply a cover, this would be an option to create the cover one wants, change the colors, maybe even edit ones that already exist to our lip kings.",0

The writing algorithm is still not smooth and quick enough at times, leaving some strokes not accounted for. It was improved since the release of GoodNotes 5, but still needs more refining. Also an undo button in the zoom window needs to be added back. Finally, the “close tab” keyboard shortcut was removed unfortunately and I wish it was put back, on top of sometime the keyboard shortcuts not responding randomly unless the app is closed and reopened.

My only gripes are small nitpicks and nice-to-haves
- Adding pages requires far too many taps or the inconvenient tap-n-drag option
- Context menus don’t disappear after selecting an option, only when you tap elsewhere on the screen 
- Select tool doesn’t allow you to change formatting in anyway (and I don’t think you can use it to move typed text around, can’t remember right now)
- Highlight tool doesn’t work as effectively in dark mode
- The lag on the pressure sensitive tools make it difficult to write quickly (I’m not sure if that’s the right term for it because it looks to me more like it’s trying to beautify the stroke)
- It would be nice if the geometric / shape tools had the “ snap grid” - like functionality of other tools. Or a ruler, something that allows literally straight / perfectly arced lines. It can also be difficult to draw consistent shapes with the tool without such guides.

Otherwise, I’ve almost completely replaced my bullet journal with this app. I appreciate the ability to set this app up just like my analog journal. The ability to make and import specially formatted pages is especially nice. It’s like having a custom journal that’s never locked in stone. I also really like the search function.

The eraser isn’t fully functional either, I tend to doodle in class at times, and when I try to erase all of it and continue taking notes, the eraser doesn’t fully erase everything. As soon as I lift my pencil back up, some of it reappears. Also, I thought i was just imagining things, but I also found that the palm rejection on this one is worse.

Some issues I’ve had are for starters I’m left handed and there really isn’t a great place to have the tool bar without my arm/hand hitting it and messing with my pen colors/type of pens which is a bit frustrating. Also, there is such a limited supply of pen styles I was hoping for similar to the Apple notes but no such luck the free notes app has more options...shame.

After selecting the select tool, it makes the pen, eraser and other options go away. It takes another click to again open up the pen option . 

Then, you can select the pen. But it’s located on the very far left side of the page. You just want to write on the page but Its not over yet . 

Then, you have to travel back to the right side of the page to click on your color. 

THEN , you have to click on another button to choose the pen size . 

To recap , thats move right, click, click again, move left, click, move right, click, select, click again, select.

It takes you all over the screen and it’s very irritating to get anything done.

In goodnotes 4, the select tool and pen were centimeters away from each other and it was easy to go back and forth as one does when using goodnotes. The color and pen size were located together under the pen setting instead of being separated between the left and right side of the screen AND it was all under the pen option instead of being 3 separate buttons like goodnotes 5 has it.

Goodnotes 4: click, click, click, select, select. This accomlishes the same thing and is way easier to use, faster, and more convenient. Whoever designed the buttons did not put any thought into it. Fire them.",0

Hence, I decided to give GoodNotes 5 a try. I haven’t looked back since. The app carries over almost all of the essential features of OneNote but also adds all of the features OneNote fails to provide. Big ones for me include multi-tab support, being able to add PDFs to folders without adding them to notebooks, advanced handwriting features including better handwriting to text recognition, significantly faster opening/closing of notebooks and search, and better organization. My only concern is that there is no auto-backup. I am rating 5 stars because I know that GoodNotes 4 has auto-backup and thus am hoping the developers are working on that feature, since GoodNotes 5 is still relatively new.

Give is an option to change colors, bold, underline and then go back to my default settings. 
There should be a place to click save changes in the menu to establish a default. I have a large document on my good notes and I do not want to change apps but not being able to save my settings and having to change EVERYTHING for every line is not the way I want to spend my time.

3664155185,Some setbacks that really take me out of it.,hydrasplatling,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id547692667,5.0.2,3,"Very taken aback by the loss of the undo buttons at the top of the zoomed in portion- it interupts my writing flow and forces me to either reach all the way to the top of the screen or switch to the eraser, all of which disturbs my line of thought with my writing. 

There's also a major issue with the lasso tool's functionality. When I copy some selected handwriting then paste it, I can't change the text's color until I place it, reselect it, then color it. Also, the handwriting seems to blend together strangely when placed on top of each other, whereas in Goodnotes 4 they were simply layered, with your selection being neatly placed on top. 

I'm in love with some of the more powerful upgrades, like the multiple pen types and the highlighter lining in straight lines, the folders, and how clean the layout is, but those issues I mentioned before really ruin the experience for me. I hope those issues are fixed soon so I can enjoy the app, but for now I'll be using Goodnotes 4.",4
4815131922,Coming along,Msgeorgia630,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id470839336,5.2.3,3,"This app has UNLIMITED potential. I love the new changes and upgrades since GoodNotes 4, however, I can only give 3 stars because even with the numerous updates, there are still MANY major glitches. My app crashes constantly when trying to perform tasks such as changing to font of text. Any text that is copied into the app from another source (messages, internet, etc.) glitches. Even if it’s standard, system font. 

It’s quite frustrating. Once this app is fully functional, it’ll be perfect, but the number of bugs within this program is disheartening. I’ve lost several notes altogether from the crashes in this app. Hoping for a resolution to the issues very soon. I’m trying to keep faith. Notability is still no comparison to this app in my opinion, and I paid for both. Still a fan of GoodNotes.

UPDATE: 

I bumped this app to 4 stars instead of 3 because the tech support are working diligently to improve it! The features are amazing (once they all are working properly). I’m an avid GoodNotes user, and I must say I have tried competitors, to include Notability, and other than the continuously scrolling document, and the recording feature, there is nothing better in that app than what’s offered in GoodNotes. I prefer the old shape tool in GoodNotes 4, but I’m getting used to 5.

Update: I went back down to 3 stars because this app is updating but also with additional glitches. I need this app to work the way it is supposed to.",0

The downsides to GoodNotes 5 so far is the LAGGING. Writing, erasing, undoing, etc. I don’t know how many times I had to try to write the letter “R” before I gave up and went back to GoodNotes4. (*update. Seems better! but when there’s a lot of highlighting, page loading takes a long time) 

It would be better if highlighter could be added to the “shape” button. 

Also, the photos are a little odd; when I try to add a new photo to the page, the previous one disappears randomly. (*update. Still does it... :( )

The shape creating button doesn’t allow SMALL circles to be drawn, squares are really hard to draw; it makes a trapezoid, not a rectangle.. 

It would be great if there were more pen line sizes available.
Also, there are a lot of random moments when the screen just zooms out when I’m writing and makes a line across the paper.

(3/7 update) 
LAGS a LOT loading/writing/erasing/etc. when there’s a lot of writing & highlighting on a page. I know that it’s not a problem of my iPad bc other apps with the same amount of writing and highlighting doesn’t lag. Could you please address the lagging problem?

When copying & pasting writing : the pasted content is the one that was copied before, so need to copy twice.

Sometimes selecting something makes it disappear from view

Sometimes cropping makes the image disappear completely.",0
4083496133,Disappointed,Allesan,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101748594,5.0.30,1,"Very disappointed with the new version. Felt like the writing experience on GoodNotes 4 was more smoother. Sometimes the app would not catch my writing strokes or it would disappear so I would have to rewrite things. Lastly, the most frustrating part is that sometimes it would stop responding to my Apple Pencil all together. At first, I thought it was just my pencil, but my pencil responded to everywhere else on the screen but the notebook. I was still able to click around on the top bar with my pencil, but would not be able to physically write on the page. The only way to solve this problem is to restart the app every time. It’s been happening more frequently which is quite frustrating. Only reason why I’m still using it is because all my class notes are currently on it and I really like the organization of the folders compared to Good Notes 4. Please make the writing experience a bit more smoother and maybe fix this strange bug. This would immediately make this a 5 star review, but for now, I’m having such a negative experience with the most important part of the app",0
3679061711,They both have their pros and cons,BMDKNR17,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id480552093,5.0.3,3,"Background: college student who has used the app mainly for downloading PDFs and editing them

So I’ve used version 4 for about half a year. I would rate it 4.5/5 stars. I think everything that it has on the app is really well done and I like the set up of the tool bar.

Version 5 has its pros and cons but I will stick with GoodNotes5. 
PRO: 
- I really like the new templates it comes with, the new note styles, columns on the lined rule, planner area, finance, etc. 
- More colors! You can choose from a wheel of color instead of the grid
- Vertical scrolling
- Highlighter automatically corrects to in a straight line 
- Folders! Better than the drop down menu from before. Easier to see what there is.
- You can make a quick page instead of having to make an entire book for just one page

CON: 
- the highlighter is not able to be used for the tool that used to allow you to draw perfect shapes, only the pen
- Scrolling between them is a bit buggy when in zoom atm in comparison to GN4 but I’m sure that will be fixed in time so not major 
- I don’t like (personally) how the pen tool is far away from the shape tool. I wish they were closer together for a quicker switch but maybe that’s something I have to get used to. 

Overall: I like what GN5 offers option and organization wise. If you only want simple features, go with GN4. It’s a great app that is v solid. If you want more options and a bit more customization, go with GN5",0

I’ve had an issue multiple times where my text has been randomly copied over to another page and overlaid and I can’t undo this AT ALL and had to delete the text that was written over and rewrite this. I am a student and was using the app to take notes for finals but rewriting notes has been a complete waste of time... (note that I KNOW I’m not the one who copied over as I have tried undoing all the activity that I have done in the specific session when the notes got copied over and yet I couldn’t remove the copied text).

It’s got a few bugs, but I haven’t hit anything severe yet (although I also opted not to import my GoodNotes 4 documents, since most were old and everything worth saving was exported as a PDF, so I only have a few notebooks so far). The context area of the toolbar makes swapping tool parameters really fast, and I find myself using colors more often than I did before when it was a two tap process. I also vastly prefer the folder structure over the categories, although it’d be nice if they were visible in iCloud Drive (maybe when the Mac version is released?). There’s no reason not to get it if you paid for GoodNotes 4 and take advantage of the bundle—even if you got it on sale, it’s well worth a few extra dollars to move up.",0

I used to be able to quickly change 3 colors and go back in the close up box note taking mode and now have to go all the way to the top of the page to change ink and go back. It’s a small thing but it makes taking notes less functional and as a college student function wins our over being pretty. I love the folder set up and I may import my GoodNotes 4 notes into GoodNotes 5 for studying purposes. Basically, GoodNotes 5 added some pretty new features while taking away the more user friendly features that made GoodNotes 4 so amazing. It would be great if they could keep the new folder interface and improved notebook covers and templates but integrate back in some of the GoodNotes 4 features. As it stands, this is a pretty package, but I’ll be switching back to the older version unless they make some significant changes to this newer version.",0

It’s so simple, yet it gives a lot of help in taking notes during lectures. However, with the recent update to GoodNotes5 I’ve noticed that the undo/redo buttons have been placed at the top of the page rather than in the zoom box like in GoodNotes4, which makes it pretty uncomfortable to reach that far every time you want to undo a mistake. How about implementing the double tap technique that all other art apps are having? Where you can just double tap the screen to undo and triple tap to redo. That would definitely help students take notes much faster. I wish this can be fixed soon to make the experience of this app as good as it used to be with GoodNotes4. I really appreciate the work the developers have been putting into these apps and I wish them the best with all their projects/apps. 💙",0

The app is now usable and while not perfect, it is still a worthy upgrade from Good notes 4, especially for free. The eraser is still finicky too, otherwise it would be a 5 star app. 

Original Review: Originally I was happy with the update but as I use it more and more the shortcomings are more apparent. I cannot crop images I take using my camera, meaning each photo takes up an entire page, not ideal for taking pictures of slides during lecture. Additionally if you're not careful the toolbar will disappear when double tapping and won't reappear until you hold down and activate the zoom function. Finally the eraser seems to have issues some of the time actually erasing where I indicate which can be annoying. I feel that this app is a couple updates away from being really good.",0

But I’m taking 2 stars because:
1. The app is made for handwritten notes, but we all know that some classes and some circumstances make typing more convenient. Even though you have the option to insert text boxes, don’t even try to type notes in here. Its a nightmare. 
2. After using this app for 15 minutes or so, the apple pencil starts “skipping” and “cutting” your lines, and a significant delay occurs. The only way to make it stop is by closing the app entirely and reopening it. 
3. I’ve yet to be able to make a single circle using the shape option. You’ll get a number of inconsistent roundish shapes, but never a circle.
4. Sometimes it takes the app a small eternity to open a notebook, show the pages, or load the full page (and stop showing a pixelated version of it) 

It could also use some features, like:
1. Sticky notes/notepad: Please add something somewhere that allows you to create a movable note or add a notepad in/on the side of a documents to take notes, write reminders, or else. 
2. Keyboard: Please give us an option to deactivate the apple pencil and use a keyboard or the ipad keyboard to type notes.

This app is by far the best app for notes and annotation I’ve ever used. I use it on iPad Pro with Apple Pencil—and the updates with the new iPad OS are phenomenal. For my research, I need to highlight and annotate a lot: the app works perfectly for this, even for PDFs that are 400+ pages long. Handwriting is smooth and fast and it recognizes/searches my handwriting! I use it to take notes in class by appending pages to articles or chapters and I screenshot and annotate handouts. I also really like that I can export the PDF with or without annotations, it’s super helpful to share notes or documents with colleagues. I’ve even used it to draw diagrams and handouts for presentations, edit/send PDF forms, and stitch together documents. It’s perfect for academic use.

3674673099,So close to greatness!,Saurabh D,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id215312181,5.0.3,3,"I paid for this app over so many other writing apps because it offered better shape drawings over other apps. However, there are numerous shortcomings. I want to create process diagrams and flowcharts and it is so difficult to get perfect circles, rectangles and triangles by hand. It often ends up creating trapeziums, ovals/ellipses and irregular triangles. 
App should favour:
1) Rectangles and Squares over Trapeziums. 
2) Circles over ovals and ellipses. 
3) Equilateral or Isosceles triangles over irregular triangles. 
4) Snap lines between shapes so that line just touches two objects. 
5) Allow for better arrow heads on the lines. 
6) Easy shape fills - I still haven't figured out how to fill shapes eith colors. 

I understand it is hard problem to figure out whether user intended to draw rectangle or a trapezium but in most scenarios I would wager it's rectangle or square and circle instead of ovals. May be give an option as soon as app auto draws the shape to change it to what user wants i.e. draw rectangle as default but give option to change it to what other shapes app could hzve drawn in a transient contextual menu of some sorts.

Finally, there should be quick one tap option to move the toolbar from top to left so that I can continue to draw with right hand and br able to select between multiple options using left hand, with which I am holding the ipad.

I have tried all basic IT troubleshooting steps and nothing is fixing this problem. This app is unusable to me after I just bought it despite the promises of all the great features I’ve seen everywhere on the internet.

I also like being able to import files as pages so that I can write directly on the info that my teacher uploads. This also lets me create my ideal planner layout in another app and upload the pdf to my planner notebook! 

I’m only giving it 4 stars because it’s missing a few things. In order of importance (in my opinion):
- I would be so helpful if you could view multiple pages or notebooks in the same screen as a split screen. Ohh that would make everything so so much easier!
- I wish I was able to sync my notebooks with Dropbox or even the built-in Files app. iCloud sync is great & appreciated, but it’s not the same
- I wish I was able to set up more than 3 pen colors to permanently display in the toolbar. I use color coding a lot in my notes and I don’t like having to open the pen color selection drop down when I need a fourth color
- being able to change the opacity of highlighters would be great too! 

Overall though, I’m really enjoying the app, which is why I gave it 4 stars even though I think it’s missing some stuff. It’s easy to keep everything organized and is really intuitive to use. I hate paying for apps because I never know if I’ll actually like them, but this one was worth it :)",0

Used GoodNotes 4 before and was hoping this was gonna be an improvement on an already good note taking app. And while aesthetically more pleasing, there are a few bugs that are making my everyday note taking experience a real pain in the donkey.

When erasing, the text will disappear, as it should, then reappear as if never erased, so I have to go back and erase over again, and this will happen multiple times over the same text. Minor, but when it happens again and again it becomes extremely frustrating.

Rarely, but it does happen, the app will simply not register the strokes of my Apple Pencil. Disconnecting and reconnecting sometimes fixes this, but that is a big hassle, especially in the middle of a Lecture.

And overall, the app feels laggy at times, just outright slow, staggering pixels. I’m unsure if my iPad is to blame, or if the app simply needs greater optimization. Other, more graphically intensive apps run smoothly so I doubt it is the iPad itself.

If it weren’t for these bugs I would be more than happy giving this app 5 stars, but in its current state, I’m pretty disappointed.

I love the new covers, the addition of folders, *THE IMPROVED PEN FLUIDITY*, and the ease of adding new pages to notebooks with the ability to choose white or yellow pages.

Many issues with the app are just things that already have clunky solutions that could use improvement. The shape tool doesn’t initially seem to make perfect shapes like in GoodNotes 4, but upon further inspection the turnout of the shapes relies on what kind of pen you’re using when creating them. (Ball point, calligraphy, etc.) I find that ballpoint works best for perfect shapes. It also seemed like you can’t edit font sizes, but you can resize them by pressing and holding the text box and clicking “resize”. This is, admittedly, pretty annoying.

4973203882,Chose this over other purchases,TenbW,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31955673,5.3.6,4,"I love GoodNotes! I especially love creating different subject notebooks and being able to use my Apple Pencil so creatively and intermingled with text. I bought several note-taking apps at once, and this is by far my favorite, even with others having a few better features, and even though I cannot save notebooks or pages in a way that is useable with other apps or documents. 

My biggest complaint is the time it often takes to open GoodNotes, as I often get the message “Preparing your library for a faster experience,” and the frequency and amount of time it takes to do this is significantly increasing. If I start to open it and leave it “preparing” while I go to another app, when I return, it has not proceeded and I have to continue to wait.   This makes it very hard to use GoodNotes as an easy, quick note-taking app, as my thought is often gone or my session is well in progress by the time the app opens to allow me to use it. 

Also, I would like to see a choice for a handwritten note, lassoed and converted, to use that conversion in the note itself, with both options of either replacing the hand-written note, or of using the conversion and keeping the hand-written note. As it is now, the only choice I see is to export that conversion.

The updated search feature is very nice and I appreciate that searched words are no longer highlighted in yellow. Also it is much easier to add pages and documents, which I am grateful for. However it is missing an important feature that I used a lot in the previous edition, which was the ability to name bookmarks. I’m still going to rate this a 5/5 because my understanding is that this should be changed in the near future.",0
4154717678,Key features still missing,Charcat22,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40527392,5.0.32,3,"-Really need tools in zoom box
-Really needs ability to have 2 documents open side by side 
-Shape tool usage is different (ie can’t use shape tool+highlight). I switch back and forth between straight and curvy lines very very frequently, the shape tool being it’s own pen makes it hard since I have to switch back and forth rather than turning it on or off, meaning switching between 2 buttons instead just tapping the same button. Severely decreases efficiency. Also, drawing circles in a small scale results in wavy circles. 
-EXPORTING: Exporting PDFs does not retain any inserted pics/graphics. You explain why on the website but this severely limits my use ability of this program.
-As an engineer the graph/engineering paper option no longer being present is very annoying. I tried importing a blank page from the old GoodNotes 4 but it seems to have a scaling issue.
-I would love to be able to zoom out more. The max distance seems to be set to the page width, and sometimes a bit more zoomed out would increase reading comprehension for me.
-Still unable to view multiple documents side-by-side, huge time waster clicking back and forth and unable to compare things.
-When navigating through my documents is there no way to just go back to the documents I already have open? I always just click on another document and close it immediately.",0

GoodNotes 5 comes closest to fulfilling the potential hinted at by the Apple Newton. I have demonstrated this app with an Apple Pencil to people at work and around town. Everyone is amazed and wants this technology.
I showed this to my daughter who is trying to get into law school and demonstrated to her that this app holds the potential for being able to review any notes she takes from any class at any time. She was enthralled.  The potential is mind-boggling.
It’s a great app and everybody involved in developing it deserves a substantial raise.  Very well done! I am looking forward to the Mac version of GoodNotes five when it is finally released. Thank you, GoodNotes Team, for this app.

P.S.: I want this app on my iPhone with an appropriate Apple Pencil.  (Sorry, Steve, my fingers just don’t cut it).",0

I use this on my iPad and I have tried so many note taking apps, and this is the best by far. Everything works so seamlessly, from moving pics in and around your doc, to writing on said pics, to highlighting and erasing, to inserting typed text—it is amazing. One of my favorite features is the ability to lasso text you wrote and then move it around. Sometimes you’re taking notes and realize you want to insert more text or a pic between a couple lines you wrote. Super easy to do with this. I also love that it updates on the cloud to all devices (really looking forward to GoodNotes 5 for Mac to be released).

Also the interface for organizing different notebooks and folders, and for inserting new/different style pages in a notebook is amazing.

That change I can deal with, but the issue that I’m really having is that when I try to erase something the app doesn’t erase everything that I try to erase. I don’t have on the erase entire stroke feature because I don’t always want to erase the whole stroke, but for some reason the eraser isn’t everything that I go over with the stylus. If they fixed this issue, I would rate it higher because I love this app for taking notes in class, but this issue with the eraser is really slowing me down.",0

After watching some videos this seemed like the best option for me and GoodNotes is very nicely laid out and easy to use so I’m very happy with the design. 
My main issue (and reason for the low stars) is due to the frequent glitches when I write. The app will flicker and fail to register my stylus or finger and I end up with a series of dashed lines instead of words (it does the same with erasing or circling too). The older version let you connect any Bluetooth stylus and never had this problem but this one only uses Apple Pencil. I know for sure that it’s the app causing this because otherwise the stylus and my iPad work fine. Also, after glitching for a while the app crashes (though everything is saved) but it wastes my time as I am trying to write.

Please add a “ruler” function to the note. I know it is kinda overlapping with “shape” function, but a ruler can still be very handy,  which could be incorporated inside the “shape”, I guess.
I hope I can accurately fill color under a curve. Say I want to shadow or hightlight the area under a curve in an x-y frame, with highlighter I have to be very careful since the color may go beyond the curve easily, which is not cool. (Not sure if this feature is easy to implement.)

I’m actually happy about a lot of the new features but I’ve always been experiencing crashes, and when I write the sensitivity “jumps” and messes up what I’m writing and Good Notes 4 never did that. Hopefully they’ll be able to fix this soon. Some of the features I do like is: being able to erase just the highlighter, the fact that the highlighter “straightens itself out” when you highlight something.

For example, I’m writing something and all of a sudden what I’m writing jumps across the page so I have red ink all over my notes. Easily fixed but it’s been happening all the time, in the last version I never had this problem. I’m also getting loss of control with my pencil so I have to force quit and reconnect. This is driving me crazy I cannot get through one session of using this app without all these problems.

So far, this version removed features. Text boxes are so essential, and the need to delete them in one shot is also very important, something I used almost daily. Now, to delete a text box, I manually need to select the edit button, clock on the text box toggle, select the text box,  select all, then press delete with the keyboard on screen, then click off. That’s 6 steps in the new GoodNotes, vs the old version it took me 1.5 seconds, by long pressing the text box directly, and click delete. No keyboard, no navigating through additional buttons. This is just once example. Please bring back the quick delete feature, as well as everything else that is missing. 
Please fix the scrolling pages transition animation so it is smooth. It seems rough and hesitant through every page.

I use the app daily to teach my Math classes. I put my notes and examples up on the board using a projector and an Apple TV. GoodNotes 4 had a presentation mode that would automatically engage when connected to the apple tv. It would be nice to have that option in this rendition.  Because of this I will continue to use GoodNotes 4. 

My other concerns, if you really want to call them that, are little things. I use both the left and the right side margins while writing my notes for class. This doesn’t seem to have the option for the right side margin, at least not that I have found.  The other change that is just going to take time to get use to is the removal of the short cuts from the zoomed view. I want to look there for my eraser and especially the undo function. But that I can get used to

On the higher end, my students love it. The different options for “paper” is great for my classes which range from statistics to calculus. Most use the grid paper.  They love the ability to make the different notebooks for there classes and separate them by subjects.

Also, when using the zoom box, the template I used for the page would randomly glitch out and it would become just a blank page instead of the grid paper I normally utilize. I wish that they hadn’t removed some of the most useful features that were included in GN4, and I think that they should have spent a little more time developing this app and working out the bugs before they released it. I only used this new version for a day before I switched back to the older version. The palm sensitivity also seems to be more glitchy than it was previously in GN4.

First things first, it says that they made the writing function more smoother when in fact; it doesn’t. I honestly don’t enjoy writing in GN5 than I do in GN4. 
Second, the zoom window is really buggy. I’m not sure why but it just is! It has a mind on its own to be frank. Generally when I try to use it it either works like it’s supposed to or it just jumps to the middle of the page! I don’t really like it.

My gaming notebooks are full of scribbles and sketches of events. My yarncraft is mostly patterns imported with notes on where I am and what adjustments I made to the patterns, plus I can import supplemental images of stitches from other tutorials.

As a teacher it was exactly what I was looking for in an iPad notebook. I use it for my notes, and I use it as an electronic whiteboard in class. I love how easy it is to upload notes to google classroom for my students to refer to later. I love how they don’t see the zoomed tool when I use it as an ewhiteboard. In GN5 the organization aspect was greatly improved with the folders, the writing is smoother, and the handwriting recognition is improved. The main issue I have is the zoom tool bar is not nearly as user friendly. I really miss having the option to change color and undo from the zoom tool bar as opposed to going up the top menu bar. It may seem small, but the convenience of the old zoom tool bar in GN4 is far superior to that in GN5. I do not understand why the new version is such a downgrade in this aspect.

I was wrong.  GN5 has a lot of bugs that ruin the experience—the text box does not align with the lines on the pages.  Tab returns take you to other pages instead of remaining on the active page.  There are ghost-like flashes when you erase.  Etc.  Besides the bugs, there are two design changes that, for me, make the updated app less useful: moving the eraser and the undo/redo buttons to the top tool bar instead of keeping them on the text box.  With GN4 I could write quickly with my Apple Pencil erasing and undoing errors with only a slight movement of my hand.  I am off to find other apps that will meet my needs.

I think it is a great app to use if your in high school or college and need to take a lot of notes. It is nice not to have to carry a big binder full of paper and post its when you could just have your device. I also like how you can have certain notebooks for certain things. It is also very customizable too. When you get the app you can decide which notebook cover you want and what type of paper you want inside. For example, I tend to use the blank and lined paper a lot. The only thing I was upset about is how there was only a highlighter and pen you can write with. Instead of having the 3 different types of pens, I would rather take one of those away and replace it’s spot for a pencil. But overall, I think it is a great app to use for taking notes!",0

Pros: Easy to navigate and create new notebooks and folders.
The search function is incredible at reading my horrible handwriting, and finding my notes.
I love the feature that auto straightens your highlighting.
It’s now very easy to move and rotate with the lasso tool.
Very sensitive writing tools.

Cons:
I wish that the magnifying area had some of the writing tools in the upper bar. I hate having to stop my writing so much and find the tools on the top of the page to go back a stroke or switch to an eraser or highlighter. This was in GoodNotes 4 and I have no idea why they got rid of it.
Sometimes the app will slow down quite a bit and skip my strokes while writing with the brush pen. I haven’t noticed this with the other two, but I haven’t worked with them as much. I imagine it’s because it’s a new tool.
I wish that you could organize your notes and folders by your own choosing. Right now there is only the date and name option, but sometimes I want something listed first, even if I don’t use it as often, if that makes sense.

However, I have a big problem with the fact that since using GoodNotes 5 there is no undo/redo on the zoom panel. I know it seems picky since the undo is at the top of the screen but that is a lot of real estate to traverse given I use undo constantly when I am writing. The top of the zoom panel is obviously empty of features. It would be nice to see that screen real estate used in a meaningful way. Put the zoom undo back in the product (like it was in G4) and I will give this product a 5 star rating.

It got me into iPad note-taking on my Retina mini back in early 2014. Since then I’ve been a paperless note-taker unless forbidden (happens at work sometimes). GoodNotes 5 is a great improvement, it’s just not feature-complete yet.

That’s the not-so-great: features many have come to rely on in GoodNotes 4 are still in development in GoodNotes 5 as of this writing. Most of the bugs are ironed out (things that make it crash) but not all the fancy features are back yet.

But the good: the folder structure is great. The concept of quick-notes. The handwriting recognition. But for me, THE killer upgrade and why I will never look back to GoodNotes 4 is the handwriting “engine”. I don’t mean how it can read what I write and search it, I mean what my handwriting looks like and how responsive it is to my Pencil strokes. Maybe my handwriting is weird but GoodNotes 4 made it look like a little kid writing in crayon, jagged, crooked, etc. GoodNotes 5 is a massive improvement, and my handwriting doesn’t look like ugly scribbles anymore. It looks smooth and natural, especially with the fountain pen setting (that was unusable for me in GoodNotes 4). I don’t know why that’s so important to me, but it is.

Still no password protection of specific notebooks???

Where did named bookmarks go? The literal bookmark feature is a flattening/simplification that actually removes a feature I was using extensively in a large notebook, and now it’s a pain to find the page I want in the large notebook. Please return named bookmarks.

Why can’t we use the + to add a page from the page overview from with in a notebook? Now there seems to be only one place, the + menu in the upper right, which makes it hard to add multiple pages throughout a document at one time.

Not sure what’s up with the shape drawing function. I used to be able to draw neat little bullets with it. Now it takes my nearly perfect circles and turns them into... I don’t even know what, or sometimes weird triangle beak things. It’s definitely broken over GN4.

I do love the new brush pen, the new covers, and the new folders concept. But for $8 additional? You’ve got me in your system so I’ll pay it, but I do feel a little gypped. There’s too much that I had been relying on that’s gone, and one thing I was hoping for (PASSWORDS!) not present yet.",0

This is very inconvenient. I was hoping the convert to text option would improve so that the handwriting converts directly to text on the page after you verify the text is right, but that is not the case. I was also hoping you could erase (with the eraser or lasso) a portion of a text if you decide you don’t want it anymore. All of the text within one writing section is linked.

Some of the new features are good: Having folders is great, I like the brush type pen and the new UI is pretty. That I can’t access my documents from my Mac (yet) is a huge problem though. I’m also disappointed that the ability to select/highlight text using an Apple Pencil has not been added. I still need to use a different app for annotating PDFs (e.g. PDF Viewer).

I’ve been using this app for awhile and I’m sure an update will be released ASAP with regards to the smoothness. GoodNotes has always been ahead in that specific area compared to notability.

There have been numerous updates so far but none have seemed to fix any of the issues the majority of us are having. At this point the app is unusable for me. I’ve had to go back to goodnotes 4 because the app literally crashes after a few seconds of opening it. And this is even after installing the newest update. When trying to look at my files parts of my screen will go black over the documents. The lag is horrible when it comes to loading images and sometimes they do not load at all. I was so excited for this app to be released, and I do love all the new features. What good are they though if we can’t keep the app from crashing long enough to use them? I’m sincerely hoping that the next update starts to fix some of these things because I really do think this could be an amazing extension of an already terrific app.",0
3686655674,Not quite there,MedicPNutt,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id43701519,5.0.3,3,"I know there are a lot of new features to GoodNotes 5, like the ability to scroll horizontally to vertically and erase only highlights, but you left out a lot of the features that make GoodNotes 4 my go to note-taking app. 

1. I liked the shortcuts on top of my zoom-in box so that I am not stretching all the way to the top of my screen to change from eraser to pen to highlighter, etc. 

2. When I hit the “enter” button on the zoom-in box, if often shoots my box half-way down the page or even to the next page.

3. I like all the new paper and cover options in 5, but I miss the various sizes of grid paper. I like taking notes on grid/squared paper, but the only option I see on 5 is larger boxes, and I prefer the 3 options available to me on 4. 

4. I realize that you hope everyone upgrades from 4 to 5, but as long as 5 is glitchy, I will stick with 4, but I have had to rewrite my notes I’ve started in 5 on my original notes in 4. Auto-syncing would be nice.

I feel like most of these things are oversights and will possibly be included in the next major update of 5, but until then, I will keep using GoodNotes 4. I hope you guys fix it fast. I would love the functionality of 4 with all the new, cool features of 5. When that happens, I’m sure you will receive my 5 star review!

This app takes that ease out of my life. I have to think about which identical blue folder is for what and it takes more time out of my day because I don’t know the course names they are all so similar with very little variation, they even have the same professor. The distinction is color. I’m also sure this would help someone working on multiple projects. It’s weird to me that all my folders are blue but we have endless options for notebooks?

The application is working better, and the glitches while writing are not there. However, still erasing is visibly glitchy. 

Update: 2/6/19 After latest update
1. Randomly goes to the first page if I'm using the vertical scroll. 
2. It makes odd shapes when I'm writing o's or p's or q's. It also makes a straight line to one side when I end a letter.

I feel as if this app was not properly tested, before being released to the public. 

I’ve been using the Goodnotes 4 app a little over 2 years. I use it for everything from marking textbooks to making covers, and heavy note taking for college. I don’t use notebooks for school, this is my notebook, so that’s how much i use this. 

I love the ability to scroll up instead of page by page to the side. However I find that it is glitchy.

I love the different styles of pens. I noticed that now cursive is more clean and uniform. That being said, I use the magnifying a lot to keep my hand writing neat, but I have to rely on the arrows to continue next because I’m not able to select the width of the auto feature like in goodnotes 4.

had January 3-17th imported from Goodnotes 4. All the notes from that point on were deleted from Goodnotes 5. The more notes I put into Goodnotes 5 the slower the app became. Then it started crashing and reopening. The last time Goodnotes 5 did it, notes 18-27 were gone. Those were very important notes to me. So DO NOT upgrade until the bugs are worked out.

UPDATE: There was another update to Goodnotes 5 that brought back the pages I lost returned. I still have a few problems with the app. It's still running slow and it crashes every so often but not like it use to.

It syncs with iCloud as before and one can backup to any of the major cloud drives. It imports documents through the Files app, so this file system seems robust and modern. The note pages seem bigger due to the reduction of white space and the modernized toolbars. I was able to use all of the features immediately as they are very intuitive. The preset options for ink color and line width are much easier to use than the previous version. Also, the option for horizontal scrolling is great and I appreciate that one can easily see the page breaks. The eraser is still best in class, but the addition of erase highlight only is genius.

Adding the ability to rearrange more than one page at a time would be more efficient. As it is, if I have a group of pages that I want to move, I have to move one page, go get the next one and move it, etc. Also, I would like to be able to send a picture from Apple’s photos app instead of having to copy and paste. On that note, I’d like to be able to crop and manipulate photos taken from within the GoodNotes app as if they had been pasted from the photos app. You can’t crop photos taken in GoodNotes. How about subscript and superscript text?

The execution is just not fully there. Palm rejection is spotty, there are a lot of bug in the beginning as should be expected but it’s rendered the app unusable for me.

It also sometimes keeps erasing my previous stroke of a letter and sometimes has a hard time even just staying on the pen rather switching everything time I touch the page with the pencil between the pen and the eraser. I like the new features but until they fix the basic uses and make it almost perfect, I will not be using this. In fact it has turned me away from GoodNotes entirely for it is hard for me to stay with an app that does not even care about the basics rather just want to make a shiny new thing, if you’re going to be on the Apple App Store you might want to follow the main reason Apple is so profitable, they strive for perfection.",0

Cons: very buggy right now. Erase requires 3-4 attempts to  work right, palm rejection isn’t as solid as it was in previous version, drift when scrolling to the side makes it difficult to seamlessly write. Zooming in on imported templates causes significant lag. Lag time between writing and lines appearing on page is greater than it was in GoodNotes 4. I’ve had issues with the app freezing up when I try to close notebooks as well. 

If you use this for taking notes in school, I recommend sticking to GoodNotes 4 until these bugs are fixed. I much prefer this UI to the old one and am a fan of the new features, but the bugs disrupt note taking to the point where using the app in class is inconvenient.",1

In 5 it often fails to erase the whole selection, with little bits popping back on the page after being erased. So far I haven’t seen where 5 is able to auto backup to my OneDrive. Having the automatic backup is a great peace of mind. I would even pull up an older document on a laptop and reference it when creating a new document. Good Notes needs to get this backup thing figured out, and quickly. This is not a cheap application, and they charge you, again, for the “update” to 5.

3709980609,Meh,itsAurix,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id372796065,5.0.6,3,"The design from GN4 vs GN5 is notable and the added features I do enjoy. Such as the folders, more design options for covers, and the look of it.
 However, what I’ve been noticing in GN5 is this annoying lag/glitch when writing. I noticed in GN5 as I’m writing some of my letters glitches by creating an awkward stroke, or the writing doesn’t appear. I thought it could’ve been due to my screen protector but testing it with the GN4, this can’t be the issue. My other assumption is the palm rejection or the angling of my stylus pen. If this is the case, I’m hoping the dev team will expand different hand writing positions.( I tend to rest the side of my hand on the screen while writing.) Another problem is the lag in erasing. When I erase an area, parts of the sentence would still be left or a few strokes left over.

Another annoyance is not having the redo/undo option in the zoom box. Having to reach up to the top just to reach these features is wasting time and an inconvenience (A big flaw  for interface design)

Overall I wish the GN team just upgraded GN4 to have the aesthetics/features from GN5, than having us pay for a whole new app (well, guess this is the only way to make more profit).

I’ll most likely head back to GN4 until they deprecate the app entirely or when they fix the issues with GN5.",0

In Goodnotes 4, this situation is handled perfectly because the pen choice for each document is stored separately. However, in Goodnotes 5, this function is removed!! The pen choice is fixed all the time even though I switch document, and I need to manually switch pens whenever I work on a different document!!

I do not like the new way the folders are organized but maybe that’s just a matter of a habit. What I hate is how the zoom window now works.

And it’s laggy because in the middle of the line the “auto-advance” feature just stops working. So annoying.

1. You can’t change the color of folders. To me this seems like something that you would think is like autotmatic, but when I treid to change the color of folders i couldnt’. I have a folder fore very class so that I can put all of my assignments in that folder and also have a few notebooks in each as well. Not being able to change the color of the folder for each class is annoying and I wish it was something that was possible.

2. I love exporting notes directly from the app and being able to copy them directly into an email is also brilliant. However, you can only export “this page” or “export all.” It would be nice to be able to export specific pages or a range of pages that way I don’t have to export an entire notebook when I really want to only share pages 3-5 and 7, 11, and 34.

In GN 5 I have to constantly go back all the way up to the top of the page to change pen color and go from pen to eraser back to pen to start writing again which means I run the risk of missing information. I did not have a problem downloading the books to GN 5 from GN 4 and I did not experience crashing. However, the controls on the zoom window are too important for me.

Going back to V4 is pretty painless if you select 'flatten the PDF' (otherwise some of your text notes will be obscured by boxes). All the v5 directories become V4 categories and it works pretty well.

Beware moving the other (intended) way: V4 to V5. Buggy, laggy.  All the bookmarks are silently lost forever. I downgraded my rating from 2 to 1 after I discovered this a week later.  This makes handling 500 page books impractical - a task that is easy in V4. You will waste your life on work-arounds in V5. Just try editing a large text box as the V5 insertion point scrolls offscreen.  UPDATE: still broken. I keep checking back wondering how something as important as text insertion can be broken in a product with a 4.6 star rating.  Are they all shills?

And what in the world is F5 doing with text selection and default colors?  Sometimes selection pops up 3 choices, sometimes 5, sometimes 7, sometimes 10, and sometimes none. There is a mode here, but no user-indication of what it is. Sometimes colors change, sometimes not. Sometimes styles stick, sometimes not. Though the modes indicate the ability to change highlighter color, its always yellow. And is the only way to change the highlighting to undo?

Again, the solution is to stick with V4. Updated for v5.1.3",0

Also, it would be great if a %zoom was included so you can know how big or small your paper is and the next time you can continue using that same %, otherwise it’s hard to know if you are writing smaller or bigger than before.

I’ve also used this for college courses and I’ve talked several people into buying an iPad and Apple Pencil simply by showing them this app. 

The ability to export my hand written notes to PDF and mail them has come in handy more times than I can count. And best of all, my desk isn’t full of papers and I’ll never lose a note with iCloud sync. 

My only complaint is there isn’t a Windows app. A lot of professionals use PCs and this is a huge omission by the developer.

My main problem is simply speed. Pages take at least twice as long to load on my older iPad Pro (9.7 in). Even worse, I cannot write at full speed with my Apple Pencil without the program getting confused and not registering all of my strokes. This was never a problem with GoodNotes 4. Erasing, undoing, and scrolling are all also about half the speed of GoodNotes 4. The developers also removed tons of useful features, such as the undo buttons, eraser, and colors from the writing window. Additionally, the new UI occupies twice the space at the top of the screen which makes a difference on smaller iPads.

Just the ability to make an outline by having the text auto format to bullet style or letters or Roman numerals would be helpful. One biggest disadvantage there when writing an outline freehand is that you can’t easily just insert text in the middle... that’s why I prefer typing for outlines and lists. But it’s a chore to do outlines in this app because of the lack of those kinds of options so I just wind up using Microsoft word.

The user interface (pallettes, etc.) was hidden from the projected image; a feature not available on any other app.  This mode has not been implemented in the V5 update, so I will not be using it.

Also, due to changes under the hood, the quality of the Apple Pencil handwriting is much poorer, at least for me. (Compare for example to the annotation mode in Apple Pages or Preview, which is much smoother than available now in V5).

At least the long awaited vertical scrolling mode is available in V5, but this is at the cost of the chief advantages of the app.  I do not recommend that existing V4 users upgrade to V5 until the developers respond to this criticism, which is apparently common to several commenters so far.",0

The crashes are almost always when I’m using big PDFs with a lot of vectors or Goodnotes documents where I’ve place a lot of images. Normally I would say that’s my fault, but I’m pretty much doing the same thing in Goodnotes 5 as I did in version 4, and I was always impressed with how stable Goodnotes 4 was considering how much I threw at it.
One of the most annoying things is if Goodnotes 5 freezes or crashes, the tabs remain when it’s reopened meaning that it crashes again. It would be good if it worked more like Goodnotes 4 and the tabs closed when the app closed, or if there was a way to force close a tab.

The syncing problem is harder to explain, but as I use Goodnotes across my iPad and iPhone, I’ve ended up with many duplicate documents and folders and a lot of clean up to do. I was expecting the transition to Goodnotes 5 to be more seamless.

Most of us, students, enjoy recording our classes so we can listen to it if any doubt come up (or even listen the audio calmally when we are at home actually having time to undestand all of the insane  amount of information that we have to know). And to have all of it (notebook, pens, highlighters AND a recorder) in one app is really a dream come true.

1) split screen within the app: if the app allowed the user to view two pages/notebooks/documents simultaneously and be able to take notes on both. That would increase productivity.

2) moving select items from one page to another: when using lasso tool to move items around, it would be nice to be able to move from one page to another without having to copy/cut and paste to the other page. Increase in convenience. 

3) sticky notes: this is one thing I wish I could do. If we can add sticky notes within a notebook/document/page and able to minimize so that I can have extra notes on one page. This would be very helpful for student who are used to using sticky notes like myself. Increase in productivity.",0

Ill take notes and the app would just automatically closes its self in the middle of it. Also the paper templates be changing on they own,  And i been updating the app but it seems that its not doing o better. GoodNotes 4 NEVER crashed on me or closed itself out before.

 There are some old things I miss though. I miss the color change, eraser, and undo button being on the top of the easy note taking section. This was very useful when taking notes in class to be able to quickly change colors or fix mistakes without having to get out of my rhythm of note taking. I also liked the old way of selecting size for the pencil, I guess I was just used to the old way and will get used to this too. The easy changing of color will be hard to get used to though.

The extra star is for the scrolling direction because scrolling vertically is something I love about Notability (which I use as often as GN4) and I’m glad they implemented that but everything else is terrible. They got rid of the quick choose settings in the zoom window for some bizarre reason and when I add a cover or import a pdf nothing shows up! Also, when using the zoom window the paper template goes missing and you’re left writing on blank paper which defeats the purpose of the template. I could go on but those are the main things that are making it very hard to switch to GN5.

This is absolutely unacceptable especially since GoodNotes 4 worked so well! Now I can’t even go back to it because it wont export files onto that app anymore. 

Another thing is if you want to type on this app for any reason and you are using a keyboard, then you can’t use the arrows to go back and forth in the sentence, it will move your page for you which is seriously such an annoying thing since again GoodNotes 4 had a perfectly fine feature for this!

With the new iPadOS, GoodNotes 5 now allows me to open the same file side by side. This is very important because I often need to look at two different pages of the same file at the same time. In the past I had to make a temporary copy of that file. 
Being able to search across files is also a plus. 

The add outline feature is not as useful as I expected. I could not add outlines with layers. The outline also disappeared when I exported the file as a PDF. 

GoodNotes 5 has two big downsides, at least for me. One is the smoothness. When I flip pages in 5, it never felt as smooth as it is in 4. The other downside, probably the bigger one, is the lack of simplicity. I chose GoodNotes 4 because of its minimalist design. Now in 5 there are two lines of toolbars instead of one. Many functions that are only used occasionally such as share, insert photo, and bookmark are now in the front instead of hidden behind the + or ... menus. These changes made the user interface a lot more complicated and also reduced the space for displaying the document.",0

I first bought a different note taking app that was rated high and often on the best seller lists but it wasn’t as versatile.  I like that I can arrange different notebooks and that every page in each notebook can be a different format.  This is a great bullet journal replacement for me. I really love it!! My only regrets is that I spent $9.99 on the other app that I now never use. 
After only a few days, I already have my monthly and weekly calendars on GoodNotes. I also have used the dotted paper and the shapes tool to make living room diagrams as we are buying new furniture. Intuitive and fun to use.",0

This makes me extremely unhappy because most of the time the document that I am trying to add (import) is multiple pages and I don’t have time to waste trying to move them to the end of my document. And I really don’t have time to keep trying!  I’d like to continue to be optimistic because this app (both 4 & 5), but I’ve become frustrated and am considering purchasing a different app to take up less of my time that I can spend studying for my grad school classes.

GoodNotes 5 brought a lot of great updates and new features that are very very useful for me... but unfortunately, it crashes constantly on me to the point where I’d rather not use it. It crashes when I write too fast, when I try to copy/paste something. Thankfully when it crashes it only loses one or two things but it’s still too frequent at this point for me to feel comfortable using it, especially when I’m in a rush.

I wish a lot of the same features would have been continued over to 5. For example, Google Drive sync (this is big for me, I don’t use iCloud and I have no way to back up my notes in 5), shapes (like making a straight line, a square, a circle) should be available with the highlighter as well, copy/pasting pages is now more cumbersome... 

New features I like: color selection/addition/hex codes and overall display of the pens and highlighters, multiple levels of folders and the overall display/organization of the files, ability to organize tabs when you have multiple documents open.

My wish is that GoodNotes 5 would have been an update on GoodNotes 4, but for some reason it seems like the developers started over. Please bring back GoodNotes 4 features and build on them for your new versions.",0

I have the new iPad Pro and the 2nd Gen pencil and I use the app from anything from in class note taking to sketching for class. I like the improvement in pen colors and options for the tools but I keep having issues with the actual writing.

 The fountain pen ends up being too pressure sensitive now vs a week ago so there’s a clear difference between my notes and it starts to look messy. I have the pressure set to low but it’s still messy. The brush pen is nice for titles but even more sensitive so that’s out of the question for me. The ballpoint has this weird blunt edge at the end of a stroke that looks weird so even though it’s the least sensitive I stick with the fountain pen 

When drawing with the shape tool, especially circles and ellipses, the shape never corrects to a perfect shape. There’s always an overlap even when the original drawing had no overlap.

Exporting my docs as pdf fails when uploaded to google drive so when I try to open up the pdf to print, I’m unable to print even 1 page if I’m lucky. 

All in all, I’d like to commend the developers for how quickly the updates are rolling out. GoodNotes is a great app for school and I will always recommend it.",0

It’s intuitive order used to feel like a table of contents without actually being one. Another thing, and I know this is one that everyone wants: recording.

First, I use GN for mostly reading textbooks and writing notes. However, whenever I scroll down on my textbook the page skips or jumps to like more than 30 pages as I scroll only once. I’ve been through this problem for like 20 times when I was reading one chapter, and it totally freaked me out. If I want to scroll just one or two pages, I need to be very slow and slide not to hard to get to the next page. It is the most annoying thing ever.

Second, when I write my words for the note, I tend to write fast. I didn’t have any problem writing my notes on GN4, but in GN5 the words don’t appear as what I write if I write too fast. It delays for few seconds as I write, and sometimes it just don’t appear like what I write at all. It just makes few lines instead.

I am totally shocked about the new downsides of note taking and reading ability on GN5, I mean it never happened when I used GN4. I really like the new features like scrolling through the pages and having color sets on the menu bar, but I guess I need to go back to GN4 for now.

The update seems fine for the most part, with a few issues that it looks like the developer is working on addressing. One thing that I’ve noticed is when using a Bluetooth keyboard while editing text, the arrow keys don’t move the cursor around, but instead move through note pages. That function would be fine outside of editing a text box, but while editing text I really wish the arrow keys would move the cursor instead. I feel like it worked that way in version 4.

One thing is the usability of the shape tool; Goodnotes 4 definitely has way better shape recognition compared to this updated version, and I liked that I could select it while also using the highlighter. It’s a little annoying to have to select the highlighter and choose to draw in a straight line instead of just selecting the shape tool. Also, the ink does not look as smooth as it did in the older version. Folders are something I have been wanting for so long, so I do like this addition.

I love the new interface of the GoodNotes 5 app and the wider selection of covers however here are the problems I’ve noticed since the update.

1)When I add a text box and then tap somewhere on the page, the app goes black and closes.

2)When I use vertical scrolling and view my pages, the color of the highlighter I use, the pen ink and the template in the background are not consistent and appear darker in some areas even though I didn’t change the color.

3)I don’t like that the wide selection of graph paper that was in GoodNotes 4 is not in GoodNotes 5.

4)I think the zoom window would be better if it had all of the features the zoom window in GoodNotes 4 had, such as the pen color options, undo redo and the eraser.

I would really appreciate it if the GoodNotes team reads this and responds I think these are important problems to fix, especially the one where the app crashes when making text boxes.

I have been using GoodNotes5 since it’s release. I love all the new features they added but I’m not sure it’s worth switching over until many glitches get fixed. I’ll list a few off the top of my head:

-sometimes when writing with Apple Pencil the screen will randomly zoom out and you’ll end up with a huge line across your notes.
-zooming in and out is not smooth
-eraser still doesn’t erase everything I erase
- there is no Mac version 
-writing is not as smooth as GoodNotes4. It tends to lag.
-loading highlighted text and hand written notes in larger documents is much slower and buggy than in GoodNotes4
-cannot select images in pdf like you could in GoodNotes4 
-pen settings are now for the entire app and not tab-specific like before (previously, if I had red ink selected under one tab, and I switch out of that tab, anytime I return to that tab, I will have red ink selected or whatever pen setting I had last while in that tab)

The ability to import and export documents as PDFs straight into my iCloud Drive is also one of my favorite features.

The biggest problem I’ve encountered so far is that erasing doesn’t always erase everything, and sometimes I have to erase the same area two or three times for it to actually be erased. More recently, when writing (I use the Apple Pencil), it doesn’t seem to be able to keep up with the pen input. This causes a lot of straight lines instead of curves, so I can’t really read what I’m writing.

One feature I would really like is the ability to import covers/page templates. Most of the more “professional” covers are in boring colors, and I’d also like to be able to change the page background color.",0

You can put any types of pages in each notebook, which is a huge advantage over physical notebooks. 

As an iOS developer myself, the shapes tool is an incredibly useful feature. Drawing circles and squares are automatically connected to the nearest ‘clean’ version of the shape. Makes it incredibly easy to diagram.

There is a slight bug when using the selection tool, that after dragging elements which have been drawn on top of one another, their layering order will reverse, leaving the original background in front etc. Can’t be fixed with undo, but can be fixed by closing and reopening the app. Shouldn’t be too hard for the devs to address, overall great app experience!",0

I like the various pen options, the ability to modify the functionality of the eraser tool in options, and the snap tool.

The text boxes have bug issues. Sometimes the font and border options aren’t easily modifiable. One solution is to change to a different tool, such as the pen, and then switch back. This needs to be fixed.

The geometric tool that allows for straight lines, round circles, ovals, and various other shapes has potential, but needs improvement. It’s difficult to make circles sometimes.  There should be a sub-button that can tell the program that I’m trying to draw a circle with a certain radius/diameter rather than trying too freehand every shape unsuccessfully over multiple attempts.

It is a critical feature of GN4 that I can get to my notes and modify them in all ways from every device, Macs (plural), iPhones (plural) and iPad.  Each device has strengths that I can leverage because GN4 was supported everywhere.  Until GN5 can do the same it is severely crippled for my use.  I’ll stick with GN4 for now and wait for the Mac support, and feature parity of GN5 with 4 along with bug fixes to the things I’m seeing on reviews. 

I’m hoping “available soon” is not the same “soon” that it took to get consistent iCloud sync supported.  That was over 12 months.

I’m sure my 5 star rating will be available soon after you release GN5 on the Mac.  

 PS - please consider adding GN for Mac back to the Mac App Store until you have a full functioning replacement compatible with 5.  Just note clearly in a few places that it is not compatible with GN5.",0
3683192430,Way too many glitches...,Gtbbong,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id131963391,5.0.3,1,"Theree are way too many glitches so let me state some major issues that makes this note not almost but COMPLETELY UNUSEABLE.

1. Whenever I write (APPLE PENCIL IS INTACT WITH THE SCREEN) it randomly moves the paper creating a random line. This happens every time I use this note. Sometimes it creates a vertical line. This happens when i write english but it also happens when I write korean.

2. Eraser is way too glitchy. When I erase anything it creates a ghosting effect and it doesn’t completely remove all the words. ALSO, There are times when the erased portion comes back after erasing. What the heck right? Yes, it happens often.

3. My word randomly disappears.

4. When I lasso, it doesn’t work all the time.

I tried getting a refund via apple store but it just leads me to this useless good notes 5 website. Seriously its useless, they hid their support email. i eventually found it and emailed them but received nothing. This is just ridiculous, goodnotes 5 is making me want to go back to old school note taking.  

If you are not going to fix it give me a refund. 

Wasted 3 hours trying to figure out this note app and I am not going to spend another minute on this thing. 

I hope you read and please do something about it.",0

First, importing of documents from GoodNotes 4 to GoodNotes 5 has been terrible - extremely slow and incomplete.  Second, the new bookmark feature is poor compared to the prior version wherein you can see the Bookmarks (almost in full) listed in the document. This feature has been truncated and essentially has made bookmarking almost worthless.  Lastly, I really don’t care about the handwriting option.  The highlighting and annotation to documents is the reason I purchased and have diligently used GoodNotes.  This new version negatively impacted those important features.

GoodNotes 5 is nicely done, and in the past 2 days I have found it to be much more intuitive, and just better looking. The few glitches were to be expected and I’m sure will be resolved. The deal breaker for me is that there is no Google Drive storage option. (This is crucial because security restrictions on my employer provided device don’t allow iCloud sync. So, no file backup options for me on GN5). For this reason, I will be switching back to GoodNotes 4 for the time being.

I’ve loved it and have had no complaints. I paid to upgrade to GoodNotes 5 and I’ve had nothing but issues when taking notes. Whenever I go to erase, I have to erase several times because I erase it once, and then it repopulates part of what I was erasing. I erase again, and it does the same thing. So I have to erase one word about 3-4 times before it ACTUALLY erases. 

Another problem is highlighting. I use “squiggles” as different ways to highlight specific things (aka not a straight line). The app automatically snaps it into a straight line. I should have the freedom to highlight in any way I need, not just a straight line. 

A new problem has occurred today. I use an Apple Pencil, and the app will randomly stop allowing me to take notes AT. ALL. So that I have to shut down and restart the app. Sometimes I can’t take notes at all, and then other times I can ONLY take notes in the magnifier mode.

These issues need to be fixed immediately if this app is going to continue to be a viable note taking option. As of now, I’m very upset that I paid $7 to upgrade to a “better” version that doesn’t work.",0

I just bout a new fine point stylus that does NOT work with GoodNotes 5 but works with GoodNotes 4. This is really annoying because I don’t want to go back and forth and transfer files over that’s just annoying.

I also with the delete/back button was on the same line as the return button so that when I make a mistake it’s easily accessible. I like how GoodNotes 4 has this. Where it is now feels far away and a hassle to reach quickly when trying to write fast. 

Lastly, when I import Power Points it cuts off the right side so text and images are interrupted. This is for both GoodNotes 4 & 5, though I remember this did not happening in an earlier version. Please fix this.

Also it was easier to add the types of pages that I wanted in v4. I am split on the changes in the organizational features. I like the simplicities of v4, but I like how easy it is to modify V5.

It's clear the team has been hard at work to keep improving the app,and its my daily driver now. Taking notes on my iPad is my primary use case (after web browsing of course), and GoodNotes 5 enhances an already enjoyable experience.

I made my own paper templates, with a blue background chosen from physical blueprints of yore, using white or yellow ink.  I really love the experience.

Things that I would be happy to see implemented or enhanced: 

* for shape recognition, prefer simple shapes and angles.  Right now the granularity of snapped angles is way too fine.  I have a difficult time making a rectangle with just 90 degree angles.  Maybe a courser snap would help.

*layers.  Being able to doodle on different layers, such that different layers are selectable, movable, deletable, etc, would be a really nice enhancement.  I frequently run into cases where notes and annotations and doodles collide, and become impossible to select individually.",0

My first gripe is how buggy the app is. Sometimes my text does not load when I swipe to view a page. All I get is a white page. In goodnotes 4 this never happened. This especially happens when I want to use vertical scrolling.

Next is sometimes the app does this spasm of making three identical pages and also scrolling non stop to the first page. This is critical bug I hope they can fix.

Next is how there is no auto back up to Dropbox or google drive. I like to view my notes on my computer and also it gives me security if having notes backed up.

Also I wish they didn’t take away the feature to make perfect boxes in the highlighter tool. Now my highlighted boxes aren’t perfectly perpendicular :(

I also wish they would have horizontal continuous scrolling instead of just vertical scrolling. These aspects make remembering notes more continuous rather than abrupt single page looking only.",0

It used to be so fantastic. Now it is almost unusable.

This was the go to app for handwriting notes, but what’s missing is too painful to keep it as main app. It’s so close, so close to being the best for students if it adds these key elements

1. No sync between Mac. I need to review on diff computers or at school, so looks like I’m left with OneNote as the best option ... but if GoodNotes gets on the audio and sync, it will easily be the best

2. Text doesn’t line up with the paper. I like this app because it’s like a notebook, but sometimes it is so tempting to type on the lines rather than hand write ... but the typing tool is very limited and cumbersome to use, and doesn’t line up with the page templates.

(3) not so important, but still annoying when tools go missing after you get used to them... eg when zooming in, which I do most of the time, there used to be a tool selected on the zoom window, now it’s gone... so how? What other utilities might go away after I get accustomed to them?",0

Some productivity applications I’m frustrated because I can’t make my interface the way I want it. Not so here, I can do pretty much anything I want, and lay out My information and objectives anyway I want and change it anytime with minimal fuss. 

Two things I still find frustrating. It is very inconvenient to lose one page from a collection to work with it alone. Many times I find my ideas have offspring, and the need their own place to live in the app. I cannot paste a single page in a folder as of this writing. I must create a blank document, then add the page, and delete any other page(s) before saving. Tedious. 

The 2nd thing would simply CRUSH IT if the app would. Linking to other notes, pages, and web links. Plus one on this. 

Again great app. Well worth it and better than the others for my purpose.",0

I’m looking forward to the “undo” and “erase” buttons being added to the zoom window as well — that saves a lot of time when I’m taking notes. An additional suggested feature that I think would be very useful is to be able to open two documents side-by-side.

- Eraser tool is very glitchy: reloads erased content, freezes and doesn’t recognize the stylus sometimes. Need to reload app for the eraser to start working again.
- Not able to add multi-page templates

App just isn’t ready, but on a good track. I’ll go back to version 4 until bugs are fixed in this version.

I upgraded to GoodNotes 5 and first thoughts include:

Pros:
- Better master folder and sub folder functionality
- Ability to drag and drop documents into folders rather than needing to use the “move” option
- Easier to import templates from the iCloud
- More in-app covers and templates than previous version

Cons:
- Noticeable lag on the writing stylus (Apple pencil)... enough to be annoying
- Templates didn’t import in with the rest of the documents from GoodNotes 4
- Adding a template to a current document requires redirection to a new page to choose from available templates rather than the side pop up screen that version 4 used... much more time consuming when you’re taking in-the-moment data and need to add a new page quickly",0

When GoodNotes 5 came out I was so excited but was quickly disappointed. At first it was okay but randomly in the middle of taking notes it started to lag and not write what i was writing and not keep up. After that it would move the page randomly so i rechecked all my settings but it was still happening unless i had my long sleeve shirt covering my hand so it wouldn’t touch the screen. THEN it would not erase. I had to go over my writing at least 4 times before it would all be erased. I am very disappointed and really sad about this.

After the pretty bad tools provided in GN4 I was REALLY hoping that GN could step up and show that I should continue to support and purchase their product. 

Here is where my issue with GN5 is: My handwriting FINALLY looks good with the new GN5 but I can’t use the app long enough to actually write in it!!!! As soon as I choose the little pen doodad and start to write, my GN5 app crashes. I have deleted it and reinstalled with no success.

When you look at the functions that a brand-new, just-released GN5 offers, then compare that to apps like ZoomNotes and Notability there is no question that GoodNotes5 fell short.

I take my class notes as well as do all of my digital planning in GoodNotes so I am hopeful that this problem is resolved soon and that there is an update to fix all of the other issues the app is having as well because at this point I’m pretty over it.

Two things I found convenient in the previous version that are lacking in the new one:

1) when switching between tabs, the selected tool is now shared. For example, in the older version, I could take notes under one tab with pen while using the highlighter function under the other tab, and the two would function independently. Now, whichever tool selected is shared between the different tabs. I found it a bit inconvenient because I have to remember to switch to the other tool when switching between tabs.

Pros:
- free bundle when GN4 was purchased previously 
- vertical scrolling available
- quick note option (no need to make notebook)!
- folders, subfolders
- more variety for paper types, sizes, etc.
- great color selection and customization 
- “erase highlighter only” option
- rotate images & text
- fill shape w/ color option

Eh, okay:
- highly sensitive shapes tool
- limited “add” option for images (i.e. not as intuitive as the add menu in GN4)
- ink size customization via manual slider

Cons:
- no voice-recording
- no side-by-side view of different notes
- noticeable lag when rotating device & writing quickly
- no automatic backup options other than iCloud; I can backup a full zip file to Google Drive but it’s manual
- no undo, eraser, and color options on zoom window
- limited customization of margins compared to GN4
- no double tap to undo

GN5 is not entirely horrible like some people are ranting, but it definitely needs some tweaking. I’m happy enough to wait for updates to fix the bugs.",0

Next, when using the text boxes you have physically to select the text in the text box to change the size of it rather than the program skipping this time consuming step and assuming by clicking the text box all the word inside will change to the font size you choose, as is the case in Goodnotes 4..it automatically selects all the text in the text box and increases the size uniformly. On the bright side I do like the fact that you can deploy a text box with one click in Goodnotes 5 vs the two in Goodnotes 4...you do save some time here when rushing to capture lecture notes.

3758719934,Bring back the pen and eraser options in the zoom box!,Aileenback,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id129565188,5.0.9,2,"I LOVED GN4 and this upgrade was such a huge letdown. I liked that in the GN4 zoom box they brought down the traditional pen colors (red, blue, and black) as well as the eraser function down to the zoom box because as I’m writing, I don’t have to move the pen far, which makes me lose my place in writing and doesn’t help with writing consistency. I also have had issues with the pen not finishing the stroke or just disappears altogether. GN4 didn’t have problems with pen strokes.

Because I was unhappy with the changes, I tried to switch BACK to GN4, however the transition to change back all my notebooks from GN5 to GN4 was not easy at all and I didn’t want to risk losing my notes, so I’m dealing with 5.

I know that a lot of my issues are first-world problems, but you had such a great app previously and lost so much of it in this new upgrade. 

I will say that I do like the new layout in the menus and the overall aesthetic of GN5, however function is more important to me than the looks. Please bring back some of the old functions!!",0

It seems like they tried to make it look more smooth because it corrects some of my strokes but then it just makes it frustrating to write. My handwriting doesn’t need to be smoothed out, and this is even when the polygon feature is off. The timing of the writing definitely is not as smooth as it once was as there is some lag now. In addition, polygon tool doesn’t make nice circles anymore but just makes blobs which I could draw without the polygon shape.

There is still not as seamless of a writing experience as in the older app which continues to be disappointing but if it keeps improving I’m sure we’ll get there very soon!

Things that are still issues:

- when writing, the first stroke of whatever I am writing will cut off often and leave a flat surface instead of curved which leaves the work looking unprofessional and definitely not the precise writing experience one expects

- writing in the zoom box is somewhat challenging because it will jump back over your old text instead of continuing across the page AND there’s no undo button anymore still so no easy way to correct this mistake. One or both need to be fixed.",0

Two things I have in mind right now are: the size of the text field is too tall and selecting the text field, even when not trying to edit it, automatically shows the software keyboard.

For the size of the text field, every time I want to drag one I always end up dragging another one that’s on top of below it. This is because the text field is so tall even though the font is significantly smaller. Make the height of the text field equal to the height of the text.

As for automatically displaying the software keyboard when selecting a text field, this always occurs when I want to drag a text field. I can’t drag it properly because the keyboard would show up and cover half of the screen.

I mirror my iPad onto big screen via Apple TV and a projector. A couple days ago, I found a technical wrong point with the usage of this app, especially at mirroring. 

When I was mirroring my lecture note in Goodnotes, I tried to open another app side by side (split view). Suddenly, I found that mirroring Goodnotes with another app just doesn’t work. I test this with another app, i.e., PDF Expert & Safari Split view, and guess what... it just works. 

I guess mirroring Goodnotes means whole screen only, and no split view options. You guys should update so that people should be able to use split view on projector. I am pretty sure that Split view option will be very popular when mirroring iPad through projector in the classroom very soon. 

I hope you can hear my voice and quickly update the app.

2. Add a default name of quick notes. If I need to revise its name for every note, it’s not quick enough. The default name could be the time of creation.

3. Automatically add one page to current note. I do believe GoodNotes can do everything I want with notes, but sometimes I want it to be quick and simple because they are exactly what I need. Pulling to add a page is redundant especially in quick notes.

GoodNotes is powerful, but it should provide a succinct way to make basic functions less painful. Notability is less powerful, but it’s elegant and easy to use.

- iCloud backup is not working (although I do have iCloud  syncing on)
- Pictures I’ve inserted into notes recently have been lost
- lag on erasing

One improvement I noticed right off the bat from the last update was the scrolling/writing lag issue. I noticed it a lot right after release, but as of the last update the problem is gone!

I never bother to write reviews and have kept to myself, but the frustration of working with this awful app is just too much. They did something right with goodnotes 4 but took a step backwards. Tried to copy notability but failed miserably. Disappointing. Not that the company will care to even read the reviews but fix it for all of us that have wasted good money for this.",0

I absolutely love the new design of the app, I love all of the new features and I think everything that was done was a great improvement. 

Cons:

The app lags tremendously. When flipping pages it takes its time, when I open a page it will display it blank and within a few second the contents of the page will appear. It also lags when erasing and writing, sometimes I erase something and in a second or two it is back on the screen.

V4 was very stable, less features, But definitely much more stability 
V5 is the opposite; I feel like a Beta Tester, every other day there is a new update which brings new unstable features and try to fix previous features.
Few issues I’m still facing
1- the text tool; many fonts won’t apply to the file no matter how many time I click them
2- text colours have the same issue; i always need to choose colour A then Colour B then Colour A if I want colour A applied.
3- the new Auto-Center for text, it will Auto scroll to the bottom of the page instead of center.
4- if you Copy a text, then paste it on another page ( or even the same page ) you lose any customizations you applied to that text; colour, Font, Size .... etc
5-Apple Pencil unbelievably buggy

Although they say they updated it, the shapes tool is far less responsive. I can’t draw shapes nearly as easily as I used to because the algorithm keeps messing up my shapes. For example, many of my rectangles and triangles turn into lines, and if even one line in a rectangle is the slightest bit off, the program turns it into an arbitrary quadrilateral shape with different angles.

I and many others are still waiting for the “fill color” feature! It might seem insignificant until you take a class that has a lot of diagram drawing involved! I think an opacity level would be helpful for this too.

The other updates, at a glance, seem largely UI focused with the exception of the expanded search tool. However, the UI update lacks a dark mode, which I would have loved, and think should be standard. True GN 4 didn’t have one either, but the omission with this update makes me have little faith that the company will move the app in a direction that would benefit me, especially with the dropped Dropbox support. 

The app still seems fine on its own, which is why this review is not 1-star, but as an update to my go-to note taking and pdf markup app, this update disappointed me immensely. It dropped a key feature I care about, and did not add a dark mode, which I think should be a standard option in all modern apps.

I do have notability but I like the way GoodNotes has their organization system. I can have different notebook for different classes and it's Classwork/homework.
