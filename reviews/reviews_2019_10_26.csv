5016693553,Missing Crucial Features,Sunny해,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id532346922,5.3.7,2,"Missing Features Present in Older Version:
- Zoom window shortcuts
- Automatic Google Drive backup

What I miss from GoodNotes4 are:
- Quicker menu system (drop down list; no flashy transitions/animations when moving between folders)
- Smaller file sizes on Cloud. I moved files to GoodNotes5 and once they synced to Apple Cloud, these files took more space on Cloud than they did while on GoodNotes4.. it’s strange.

What I do like about GoodNotes5:
+ Dark mode
+ Ability to bring up multiple notebooks at a time",0

I obtained this app to convert handwritten notes into text for my case notes.  I expected to be able to do that efficiently, ie an entire document at a time.  The “lasso” is too cumbersome. 

I tried repeatedly to contact “Support,” but all contact is refused without “Capta” which is NOT visible on iPad or iPhone. I expect easy responsive “Support” contact, not calculated intentional impediments.  How do I obtain a refund?

My question:  “Is there a single button, selection etc to convert an entire document at one time?”  If not, I would not have bought the app.

Unless and until these impediments are corrected, DO NOT BUY APP!",0

4973203882,Chose this over other purchases,TenbW,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31955673,5.3.6,4,"I love GoodNotes! I especially love creating different subject notebooks and being able to use my Apple Pencil so creatively and intermingled with text. I bought several note-taking apps at once, and this is by far my favorite, even with others having a few better features, and even though I cannot save notebooks or pages in a way that is useable with other apps or documents. 

My biggest complaint is the time it often takes to open GoodNotes, as I often get the message “Preparing your library for a faster experience,” and the frequency and amount of time it takes to do this is significantly increasing. If I start to open it and leave it “preparing” while I go to another app, when I return, it has not proceeded and I have to continue to wait.   This makes it very hard to use GoodNotes as an easy, quick note-taking app, as my thought is often gone or my session is well in progress by the time the app opens to allow me to use it. 

Also, I would like to see a choice for a handwritten note, lassoed and converted, to use that conversion in the note itself, with both options of either replacing the hand-written note, or of using the conversion and keeping the hand-written note. As it is now, the only choice I see is to export that conversion.

I highly recommend GoodNotes!",0

I use this app all day every day for notes and markups on plans and documents, sharing things with my guys in the field, meetings with owners and architects, and a huge list of things that are basically note taking on a higher level. Everyone who sees me using it on my iPad wants to know what it is and several have incorporated it into their own work flows. Its wonderful.

The only thing that really needs work, based on my usage of the program, is the way it receives documents when I’m using the Dropbox app. In Dropbox, I click on the options tab and hit export to send it over to GoodNotes 5. That works perfectly every time for a single document. But say, like today, I have 38 individual documents to review and mark up as part of a new set of plans. I can select all the documents in the DropBox app and I can click Export and I can choose GoodNotes 5, BUT GoodNotes 5 will only save the document at the top of the list and none of the others are imported into GoodNotes 5. So I’m forced to go through them one at a time and click and save and change apps and click and save again etc etc etc. Very VERY tedious when all the infrastructure is there to simply import the whole batch to my folder of choice in GoodNotes 5. This needs to be fixed in the coding. It would make my day so much faster. Especially if I’m trying to do this in front of a client for the sake of a running conversation.

Please add a “ruler” function to the note. I know it is kinda overlapping with “shape” function, but a ruler can still be very handy,  which could be incorporated inside the “shape”, I guess.
I hope I can accurately fill color under a curve. Say I want to shadow or hightlight the area under a curve in an x-y frame, with highlighter I have to be very careful since the color may go beyond the curve easily, which is not cool. (Not sure if this feature is easy to implement.)

It's clear the team has been hard at work to keep improving the app,and its my daily driver now. Taking notes on my iPad is my primary use case (after web browsing of course), and GoodNotes 5 enhances an already enjoyable experience.

I made my own paper templates, with a blue background chosen from physical blueprints of yore, using white or yellow ink.  I really love the experience.

Things that I would be happy to see implemented or enhanced: 

* for shape recognition, prefer simple shapes and angles.  Right now the granularity of snapped angles is way too fine.  I have a difficult time making a rectangle with just 90 degree angles.  Maybe a courser snap would help.

*layers.  Being able to doodle on different layers, such that different layers are selectable, movable, deletable, etc, would be a really nice enhancement.  I frequently run into cases where notes and annotations and doodles collide, and become impossible to select individually.",0

The undo and redo buttons, and the three colors and the eraser were all apart of the zoom window, and much more convenient than reaching to the top of the screen every time I had to undo a pen stroke. I don’t even want to consider using GoodNotes until the zoom window is copied from GoodNotes 4. While it may seem like a silly feature, it made the app 100% more useful to me. I hope this is taken into account and an easy fix to to release soon. 
Thank you,

The new updates have vastly improved my experience. Dark mode is great and iPad OS integration is awesome. Again, I’d love to see more writing tool options.

My previous requests still stand. I’d even be willing to pay for extra features as expansion packs. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 

so to make this brief... it’s pretty much the perfect note taking app in every single way with the exception of a few criticisms/missing features:

1) please offer an infinite page option. This is popular in many note taking apps so there’s really no excuse not to have it. Would be great to not ever run out of room

2) Add a pencil option and/or writing sound effects. Pencil option is popular in drawing apps like adobe sketch and procreate and would be cool in this as well! Also when drawing in art apps, they frequently have sound effects that simulate you writing on actual paper. Including this would be a huge plus!

Otherwise it’s pretty perfect.",0

And the ball pen seems too stiff, fountain pen is a little awkward to use, and the brush pen is fine, but again the pens are something I need to get used to. I wish the eraser marks could have an option to be smaller, and not erase a whole line but exactly what my pen touches. So pens are not as fluid as it could be and may make your handwriting either better or worse. Zoom ins are great and resizing also never pixelates my writing, which I LOVE. I never write reviews, so I hope the concerns I listed will be considered and that this review helps those deciding whether or not to use the app. I wish I could download it to my computer without paying extra so that I can see both on my iPad and computer. For an app meant for taking and saving notes, it is an easy and great app to use, but pens are hard to get used to.

If you are a high school student, digital note taking is okay, but it honestly isn’t necessary and teachers and classmates usually feel weird about it. In university this app is perfect since in my classes there is a lack of space for desks and so many places to walk to so the portability of a tablet is more useful then (this app also allows for split screen which is convenient)",0

My only gripes are small nitpicks and nice-to-haves
- Adding pages requires far too many taps or the inconvenient tap-n-drag option
- Context menus don’t disappear after selecting an option, only when you tap elsewhere on the screen 
- Select tool doesn’t allow you to change formatting in anyway (and I don’t think you can use it to move typed text around, can’t remember right now)
- Highlight tool doesn’t work as effectively in dark mode
- The lag on the pressure sensitive tools make it difficult to write quickly (I’m not sure if that’s the right term for it because it looks to me more like it’s trying to beautify the stroke)
- It would be nice if the geometric / shape tools had the “ snap grid” - like functionality of other tools. Or a ruler, something that allows literally straight / perfectly arced lines. It can also be difficult to draw consistent shapes with the tool without such guides.
- it would be nice to be able to add tags to notes / notebooks/ pages for searching and categorization",0

For my research, I need to highlight and annotate a lot: the app works perfectly for this, even for PDFs that are 400+ pages long. Handwriting is smooth and fast and it recognizes/searches my handwriting! I use it to take notes in class by appending pages to articles or chapters and I screenshot and annotate handouts. I also really like that I can export the PDF with or without annotations, it’s super helpful to share notes or documents with colleagues. I’ve even used it to draw diagrams and handouts for presentations, edit/send PDF forms, and stitch together documents. It’s perfect for academic use. Excellent app and highly recommended for any student or teacher!",0
4914860873,My favorite notes app with just one downside,Zadron Xion,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1061544856,5.3.3,5,"There are only two decent notes app for iPad out there: Notability and GoodNotes. Both have everything that a notes app should have but both have also have a single downside that is pretty much the only deciding factor for which one would prefer. GoodNotes can only sync to iCloud and does not sync to any other cloud service but Notability can sync to a multitude of cloud services. I chose GoodNotes over Notability because Notability is messy with its file system. In Notability, you cannot put folders within folders which is really annoying because it makes it impossible to sort out my notes by semester, subject, hw or lecture, etc. With GoodNotes I can sort out and organize my notes using folders within folders which is far more important than being able to have it automatically sync to Google Drive. If this app could sync to Google Drive, I would give it 5 stars. There are also a few very minor bugs too but they don’t really hinder me whatsoever so I’m not complaining. Great app! Make it possible to sync with Google Drive and this will by far be better than Notability!",0

Im an engineering student and have been using GoodNotes for the past 2 years, at first i was with goodnotes4. when Goodnotes5 had a free upgrade I jumped on it. (+Points)

 In the beginning it was frustrating not being able to split screen the same app, due to ios limitations. Now that its up and running with new ipados update, its been a real game changer. Being able to download a textbook and split screen with my notebook its made note taking so much easier. (+points)

Being able to take screenshots of specific items and texts in pdf or what ever inside the app is extremely useful. (+points)

Text such in any document!! This is such an awesome feature! Its been so useful to quickly jump to exactly what you are looking for in any size document (+points)

When pinching to zoom can be irritating. Sometimes i zoom into text or a drawling to add details, and it snaps back to full screen. I believe this due to palm rejection settings. Ive seen a difference in the latest update but still happens occasionally. Sane thing happens with writing notes, occasionally i will have to restart because of false palm rejection. (-points)

All in all I'm glad i went with good notes vs its competitors. Its simple and straightforward. Tools are easy to fine. The app is simple but extremely flexible.

I very much like the app except that it’s missing some clear features.
1. The possibility to select and download multiple files at once is the one feature I miss the most. It really affects my experience with the app.

2. Another issue I find is that the app is still very buggy when importing files. Most of the time I find myself having to try to import the same thing over and over.

3. Lastly, the experience of writing is not the best. I’d be writing something and the app would delete what I had written for some reason. It may be the palm functionality. Apps like Notability have done a great job at making sure this doesn’t happen for me. I don’t want to switch but if the experience doesn’t change, I’d probably have to.

I would very much appreciate if you could pay attention to this issues. Thanks for the work!

I don’t understand how it could be so difficult to implement a simple voice recorder, or why they refuse to.  Notability has a UI that looks like a 12 year old developed it, and they can do it.

Back in February, GoodNotes developers posted to the forums stating that they were “working on it”. Are you seriously going to sit there and tell me that you have been “working on it” for the past 6 months?!?

Instead, we got a feature that absolutely nobody requested in the forums. You have GOT to start listening to your customers and implementing the features they are requesting instead of bloating the software with features that nobody wants. Stop wasting time and resources on these features and start focusing your resources on the features people want.

I thought I would give GoodNotes a try and so far I enjoy note taking much more. I have more control of the colors I use, my notes look much cleaner, and the way my notes are organized is more natural for me. 

However, the two things I would recommend for this app to be near flawless would be incorporating a way to view my notes on my Mac and when using my iPad have multiple files be split screen. While using GoodNotes on my iPad I can only have one note open at a time, which get annoying if I need to annotate a pdf while also take notes about the reading at the same time. I constantly have to transfer the file back and forth to other apps. If there was a way to have a two-page view setting or let multiple notes share the screen that would awesome. Since there is no split screen option, I would like to see my notes on my Mac so I don’t have to keep going back and forth, but there is no way to open the app on a Mac. I have to separately send everything out as a pdf document that doesn’t have updates to my notes in real time. 

Overall great app, but I think if the developers incorporate these minor adjustments it will take the app to another level in terms of function and organization!

4870125154,Lots of good but also bad,Matt_nickname_giveup,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id937682135,5.3.2,3,"There are several great things about GoodNotes 5:

1. I like the folder and favorites system. It's intuitive. And, moving a notebook to a different folder is easy.

2. The notebook gives GoodNotes a great way of distinguishing different notes, especially with the covers.

3. Handwriting is very fluid and simplified, which makes it easy to use.

4. Very easy to create new pages, add pages, add pages in between, and delete pages.

5. Very easy to add new page templates compared to other note apps.

The things that need work are the following:

1. Importing PDF documents. It's not the most intuitive.

2. When I change the text color to blue instead of the default color, the text color will suddenly change to the default color sometimes in the middle of typing.

3. Image resizing is a bit difficult because the size changes using the center of the image as the static point. Most use the top left corner as the static point.

4. Difficult to change pages when there are a lot of pages in a notebook.

5. Converting to text is a bit awkward. Having to highlight then copy and paste the text then erase the handwriting to convert handwriting to text is a bit strange. It should just convert. I have used other note taking apps and they all convert handwriting to text without having to go through a manual process.

6. No password protection for folders or notebooks. I would really like password protection. I would be able to fully convert to GoodNotes instead of having to use other apps for password protection.",0
4869805501,For the developers,Master F.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40904802,5.3.2,4,"Using Goodnotes on iPad Pro Late 2018 12.9in

I used Goodnotes 4 every day for my studies and absolutely loved the app, and after some updates to Goodnotes 5 like the more fine tuned pencil thickness and the ability to import your own page and cover templates I am finally comfortable switching over.  

After over a month of daily use I have some feedback to improve the experience of Goodnotes 5:

1. When swiping between pages there is often lag or the page doesn’t swipe all the way and I have to swipe a second time. Not sure if this is a bug, or if you just have to swipe very aggressively, but either way it definitely felt more smooth in Goodnotes 4.

2. Tool Bar Customization: 
-I would love to see a slightly slimmer Tool Bar. I have turned off the Status bar which certainly reduces the thickness to a degree, but it still feels a little too big.

-It would be great to have the ability to customize the toolbar as it is unlikely every user needs regular access to every tool. Being able to hide some of the lesser used Toolbar options could help minimize its size.

3. Thumbnail Window: 
-When opening the thumbnail window I like the animation of the pages scrolling up from the bottom but when quickly switching between pages the extra time it takes to load that animation can feel a bit long. 

-I would love the ability to close the thumbnail window by tapping anywhere outside of the window.

-When selecting a different page from the thumbnail window there is often a significant delay or the page has to be tapped several times.

——————————————————————————————

Other than that great work on the new app and I am waiting with baited breath for the Mac version. I had signed up for the beta but haven’t received an invite, maybe because the new version will be released so soon?

I love the ability to open two pages side by side, and I appreciate the ability to have 3 color options for quick access. The swipe and double tap gestures for undo and redo are also extremely helpful, again great work!",0

BUT I just switched over to the iPad 6 and finally got an Apple Pencil now that my device is compatible. It worked fine for like 3 days but now I literally can’t write anything without it skipping or lagging. At first it only happened if I was writing for a long time (which ~apparently~ they said was fixed in an update. hint: they didn’t) but now it’s always like this. I’ve tried reinstalling the app and restarting my device, updating iOS, and nothing. My pencil works just fine on other apps e.g. Notes so I know it’s just a problem with GN. At this point I might just be better off using a cheap non-bluetooth stylus again but I really hope they fix it because I have everything from the past couple of years stored on here and it’s a great app otherwise.

4866983345,GoodNotes 4 is still better,>Zyxw<,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id318411714,5.3.2,4,"This review is written on Sep 30, 2019. 

With the new iPadOS, GoodNotes 5 now allows me to open the same file side by side. This is very important because I often need to look at two different pages of the same file at the same time. In the past I had to make a temporary copy of that file. 
Being able to search across files is also a plus. 

The add outline feature is not as useful as I expected. I could not add outlines with layers. The outline also disappeared when I exported the file as a PDF. 

GoodNotes 5 has two big downsides, at least for me. One is the smoothness. When I flip pages in 5, it never felt as smooth as it is in 4. The other downside, probably the bigger one, is the lack of simplicity. I chose GoodNotes 4 because of its minimalist design. Now in 5 there are two lines of toolbars instead of one. Many functions that are only used occasionally such as share, insert photo, and bookmark are now in the front instead of hidden behind the + or ... menus. These changes made the user interface a lot more complicated and also reduced the space for displaying the document.",0

In 5, the button to select things on a page instead of write on a page is awkwardly located in the right corner of page and everything else is located underneath it.

After selecting the select tool, it makes the pen, eraser and other options go away. It takes another click to again open up the pen option . 

Then, you can select the pen. But it’s located on the very far left side of the page. You just want to write on the page but Its not over yet . 

Then, you have to travel back to the right side of the page to click on your color. 

THEN , you have to click on another button to choose the pen size . 

To recap , thats move right, click, click again, move left, click, move right, click, select, click again, select.

It takes you all over the screen and it’s very irritating to get anything done.

In goodnotes 4, the select tool and pen were centimeters away from each other and it was easy to go back and forth as one does when using goodnotes. The color and pen size were located together under the pen setting instead of being separated between the left and right side of the screen AND it was all under the pen option instead of being 3 separate buttons like goodnotes 5 has it.

Goodnotes 4: click, click, click, select, select. This accomlishes the same thing and is way easier to use, faster, and more convenient. Whoever designed the buttons did not put any thought into it. Fire them.",0

UPDATE: 
Changing review from 2 to 1 stars.  
Still waiting on the feature from Goodnotes 4 where 
you could  automatically upload a pdf of all your notes to google drive. I’m midway through my semester, and this feature still isn’t available.  I get it. Stability and performance improvements are important, but that should have been done before the release of the app.  There’s only a handful of Ipad models. So, this is going to get 1 star because I think this is a really important feature, and too many people are being far too generous with these reviews.  

Pros:
- Awesome resizing tool. Now, you can use the selecting tool, and rotate and resize.  This is super helpful for geometric shapes.  I feel like this is a feature that could have been added to GN4 a long time ago, but devs never bothered to. The feature was basically there in 4 because when adding in an image or capture.  
-  UI organization is a little neater and simplified.  
- More pen customization.

That’s about it though... There really isn’t any reason to update to GN 5 if everything was going well with GN4.  I really needed the resizing and positioning tool for geometry shapes and graphing. 

Cons:
- manual backup feature takes forever.  If you have a lot of notes, it will take several minutes to backup.  I have 2 semesters worth of notes, and it takes about 5 minutes to backup.  
- Manual backups also take up a bunch of space. 
- Where is the automatic exporting feature?  GN4 has a feature that will automatically back up your notes as a PDF to a cloud service of your choice.  For example, I would manually backup my notes to iCloud (the files get REALLLY BIG), and the automatic saves would convert to PDF straight to Google Drive.  This was such an awesome feature! 
- LAGGY. The pages with just my notes have a lot of lag. It doesn’t happen when writing, but it is very obvious when using the eraser, pressing the undo back arrow, and scrolling through pages. Popping up of notes would only happen with the higher marker in GN4, but GN5 is so laggy.  
- Not sure if there are more paper sizes and templates overall, but they removed all of the graphing paper sizes. Now, there’s just one size.  
- Pages get cutoff in printing.  I should be able to write on the entire page and not have it cutoff in the printed version.  If my page is in letter form, then I should be able to print everything in letter form... Or at least have the option to have a print preview.

That’s it for the CONS. I feel like I’m beta testing.  I will definitely come back and revise this review once features getting added and performance improves.",0
4855317087,Excellent iPados app with one severe flaw,BarryMG,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id17895882,5.3.1,3,"I teach at university, and have multiple requirements from a note taking app. I have been an extensive user of Notability, but, with the advent of drop-and-drag multitasking in iPadOS I’ve been playing with both the new Apple “notes” app and GoodNotes. In particular, I’ve been testing how well these apps handle the transfer of drag and drop data between split screens. 
GoodNotes handles handwritten and pen-written notes fluidly, and allows the most flexibility in resizing drag and dropped images, text manipulation and the like. However, one glaring flaw (unless I’m missing something) is the inability to import URL’s with a hyperlink using GoodNotes. Yes, you can drag the link as text into the app. But, to open the link, you need to select the text box, copy the url, and paste it into the browser window. Compare this to “notes” ability to convert a dragged link into a thumb window in the note that automatically opens the url in the browser window when clicked on in the note. Even Notability will import a hyperlink into a note, albeit using a rather clumsy “import url” tab and multiple steps. In today’s world, this seems like a rather glaring omission.
Fix this in GoodNotes and, IMHO, it’ll be the leader of the pack !

My first gripe is how buggy the app is. Sometimes my text does not load when I swipe to view a page. All I get is a white page. In goodnotes 4 this never happened. This especially happens when I want to use vertical scrolling.

Next is sometimes the app does this spasm of making three identical pages and also scrolling non stop to the first page. This is critical bug I hope they can fix.

Next is how there is no auto back up to Dropbox or google drive. I like to view my notes on my computer and also it gives me security if having notes backed up.

Also I wish they didn’t take away the feature to make perfect boxes in the highlighter tool. Now my highlighted boxes aren’t perfectly perpendicular :(

I also wish they would have horizontal continuous scrolling instead of just vertical scrolling. These aspects make remembering notes more continuous rather than abrupt single page looking only.",0

I mirror my iPad onto big screen via Apple TV and a projector. A couple days ago, I found a technical wrong point with the usage of this app, especially at mirroring. 

When I was mirroring my lecture note in Goodnotes, I tried to open another app side by side (split view). Suddenly, I found that mirroring Goodnotes with another app just doesn’t work. I test this with another app, i.e., PDF Expert & Safari Split view, and guess what... it just works. 

I guess mirroring Goodnotes means whole screen only, and no split view options. You guys should update so that people should be able to use split view on projector. I am pretty sure that Split view option will be very popular when mirroring iPad through projector in the classroom very soon. 

I hope you can hear my voice and quickly update the app.

1. Terrible writing simulation. The writing is better in the Apple default Notes app. It feels like I’m writing on glass. In Notability, it feels like paper. Truly astonishing. 
2. The page separation is obnoxious. Have to swipe every time I want to change a page is horribly annoying, especially if I can’t fit one idea on to just one page. In Notability this is not an issue, because the page separation is almost nonexistent. 
3. The “book” format is so dumb, but that is really just my opinion. Someone else may like it, but it just isn’t for me. 

The highlighter IS better, though, and it has eraser auto deselect.

I loved using Goodnotes 4 last semester. I was really excited for this new update, as there were a couple features such as Vertical Scrolling that I thought it lacked.

Although they say they updated it, the shapes tool is far less responsive. I can’t draw shapes nearly as easily as I used to because the algorithm keeps messing up my shapes. For example, many of my rectangles and triangles turn into lines, and if even one line in a rectangle is the slightest bit off, the program turns it into an arbitrary quadrilateral shape with different angles.

I will continue to recommend Goodnotes to friends and family because I feel that it is the best note taking app for my kind of application.

I’ve been using it for a little while and I began to fall in love with GoodNotes for note taking. The features that caught my eye is personalizing your own notebook covers, and using your Apple Pencil to flawlessly take notes with palm rejection, and pressure sensitivity. 

Pressure sensitivity and palm rejection is a big deal for me, which is why I have the Apple Pencil. What I would love to see is color options for paper such as black paper, and I’d love to sometimes remember those days of using a black board for chalk and write everything down. It would be nice if you add bunch of colors including black for taking unique, and odd looking notes. 

And overall, Goodnotes is just getting better with students or people going paperless by using their cloud storage of choice for importing their notes, and data, and being able to help the environment by using less paper using the iPad. I’m glad you made this app and hoping you keep this app going on as you make more future updates.",0

I love the new changes and upgrades since GoodNotes 4, however, I can only give 3 stars because even with the numerous updates, there are still MANY major glitches. My app crashes constantly when trying to perform tasks such as changing to font of text. Any text that is copied into the app from another source (messages, internet, etc.) glitches. Even if it’s standard, system font. 

It’s quite frustrating. Once this app is fully functional, it’ll be perfect, but the number of bugs within this program is disheartening. I’ve lost several notes altogether from the crashes in this app. Hoping for a resolution to the issues very soon. I’m trying to keep faith. Notability is still no comparison to this app in my opinion, and I paid for both. Still a fan of GoodNotes.

UPDATE: 

I bumped this app to 4 stars instead of 3 because the tech support are working diligently to improve it! The features are amazing (once they all are working properly). I’m an avid GoodNotes user, and I must say I have tried competitors, to include Notability, and other than the continuously scrolling document, and the recording feature, there is nothing better in that app than what’s offered in GoodNotes. I prefer the old shape tool in GoodNotes 4, but I’m getting used to 5.

After watching some videos this seemed like the best option for me and GoodNotes is very nicely laid out and easy to use so I’m very happy with the design. 
My main issue (and reason for the low stars) is due to the frequent glitches when I write. The app will flicker and fail to register my stylus or finger and I end up with a series of dashed lines instead of words (it does the same with erasing or circling too). The older version let you connect any Bluetooth stylus and never had this problem but this one only uses Apple Pencil. I know for sure that it’s the app causing this because otherwise the stylus and my iPad work fine. Also, after glitching for a while the app crashes (though everything is saved) but it wastes my time as I am trying to write.

4804453145,Great apps for normal note taking.,dnaihao,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1075598898,5.2.3,5,"This app is great in various ways. It provides you with the efficient management of your notes, a simple but multi-function able tool bar that contains brush, eraser, pen and all other tools you need to take notes. Also the import and export of documents are excellent for this app. I also noticed there is an online community for this app that helps maintaining features and fixing issues, which would definitely promote consumers’ post-sale experience.

The most important, at least for me, about this app is that it gives you a natural feeling for note taking process on a electronic machine. I would say Goodnote has done a decent job . There wouldn’t be any noticeable difference between writing on real paper and writing with Apple Pencil in this app. It also customizes the font of your writing trails, so you could adjust it to fit the feeling and strength you have during writing. The user interface also promotes the naturality. The UI is simple but contains all features you would ever need for note taking, so it won’t hurt the experience of note taking while providing you with enough support.

I also noticed there is another competing app named Notibility. The reason I purchased this one instead of Notibility was this one is slightly cheaper and according to many Youtubers, there isn’t a huge difference between these two apps. 

In short, I would say this app would definitely promote your note taking experience and would provide you with enough support you need for normal note taking. But it won’t hurt for you, especilly those of you guys who are picky and you want to utilize your money, to research more about the difference of this app and Notibility.

1. You can’t change the color of folders. To me this seems like something that you would think is like autotmatic, but when I treid to change the color of folders i couldnt’. I have a folder fore very class so that I can put all of my assignments in that folder and also have a few notebooks in each as well. Not being able to change the color of the folder for each class is annoying and I wish it was something that was possible.

2. I love exporting notes directly from the app and being able to copy them directly into an email is also brilliant. However, you can only export “this page” or “export all.” It would be nice to be able to export specific pages or a range of pages that way I don’t have to export an entire notebook when I really want to only share pages 3-5 and 7, 11, and 34.

I don't see very well and I cannot write for very long. I am an artist and own the Apple Pencil but most of my note taking is done via keyboard and textboxes. To input notes, I take a small portion of the screen and zoom into it. However, when the keyboard appears, the screen moves to the middle of the document? You can no longer see what is going on. Especially if you are in putting text boxes near the bottom if the screen. It's annoying. I wish this app would give a work space similar to procreate, where you could zoom in and out of any corner of the page.

Also, the straight line function is no longer disability or shaky hand friendly. For various reasons,I cannot draw in a straight line or make perfect circles, blocks, etc. The straight line function was great because it didn't matter how shaky my hands and body got, it would be a straight line. It was a really stable app. But now GoodNotes 5 no longer corrects lines as strictly. Sometimes it corrects lines, other times it doesn't.

It’s hard to get good quality black paper for writing (not drawing) purposes, please take this as an opportunity to be more amazing digitally. White brush pen on black paper.",0

4688527952,"Can’t Switch Over Yet, Still Needs Improvement!",@developers,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id498683328,5.2,3,"***UPDATE: UP 1 TO 3 STARS, KEEP GOING DEVELOPERS!*** 

MANY problems have been worked on which is great! I finally felt confident enough in my ability to keep up my same standard of work in GN5 that I made the switch and learned how to import my documents just fine.

There is still not as seamless of a writing experience as in the older app which continues to be disappointing but if it keeps improving I’m sure we’ll get there very soon!

Things that are still issues:

- when writing, the first stroke of whatever I am writing will cut off often and leave a flat surface instead of curved which leaves the work looking unprofessional and definitely not the precise writing experience one expects

- writing in the zoom box is somewhat challenging because it will jump back over your old text instead of continuing across the page AND there’s no undo button anymore still so no easy way to correct this mistake. One or both need to be fixed.",0
4688441607,More flexible than I expected,Annot8,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29326707,5.2,4,"Imported several pdf documents - love the markup ability. Example: clipped the NYT crossword puzzle from my daily newspaper’s e-edition, imported into GoodNotes 5 as pdf, and was able to fill in the squares to solve the puzzle. Trying Commit30 templates in lieu of a paper Franklin planner for a few months to see if I can go all-digital. So far, creating documents is great on the iPad, not so great on the iPhone. Reading on the iPhone is adequate for reference to already-created documents.",0

4687138902,I don’t like GoodNotes5,"Jared, Mo",https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id280016803,5.2,4,"Even though it’s developed I still think that it’s not better than GoodNotes4.

One of the reasons the way that my notes are displayed.

And GoodNotes4, my notes are organized in different shelves and categories just like a bookshelf. This is a good way for notes or even PDF files to be stored in my opinion. 

Like a class syllables or an article that I read they are stored in a shelf in GoodNotes4, which is good whereas and GoodNotes5 is different.
GoodNotes5 display files in folders rather than files in shelves and this is why I don’t like it. However, GoodNotes5 has some good features that I hope they add in GoodNotes4.",0

4682267152,Some improvements and fix needed,Mr. Bond007,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1017393236,5.1.7,5,"Great apps. I enjoy being able to organize materials in FOLDERS like a normal computer interface. Just two things. First, Please make more color available on the tool bar or bookmark; I don’t know what to call it. More color available for quick access would improve work productivity because Users would not need to keep on selecting colors from the color template. Second, when photos are copy and paste into GoodNotes, those photos do NOT APPEAR in the exported PDF. Thank you and keep up your great work! 

P.s. please add on bigger brush/pen stroke options. Thanks",0
