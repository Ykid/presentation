The ability to import any pdf into the app and annotate it makes this app very valuable for university students and teachers alike. Everything is digital and with a constant pressure to go green, this app helps.

The scrolling through documents is enjoyable, and the controls are responsive at all times. I have never had an issue with document browsing.

The ability to open the app in two different instances and do true split screen is a god send. I can have notes and lectures open simultaneously and take notes, whilst annotating, whilst reading.

I wanted to use this new updated version so badly so i gave this another try. However, when I tried to move my files to GoodNotes 5, it only imported some of the files, not all.

Downloaded the 1st time: 
I’ve just updated to GoodNotes 5 so I’m still trying to figure out and feel the new layout and organization of folders etc. And will post an update review late. 

My first impression of the 5 is that the tool bar is little too big compare to the 4, I absolutely love the previous one, simple and straight forward.  However this new update I feel it’s taking up a little too much screen space, and this is very important then you are working on a 10.5 or even smaller screen iPad. 

I also notice that when turning the iPad the transition from vertical to horizontal or the other way around isn’t as smooth as it feels compare the 4. Hopefully they will change that.",0

Edited 20/1/2019: after using further for a while, I took off one star. I concur with other users that the inking does need polishing
1) there is considerable latency in inking with my Apple Pencil as compared with GoodNotes 4 and Notability 4 (now Notability has the smoothest and most responsive ink)
2) there is a bit overzealous straightening of curves. For example, if I write “5” too quick, the bottom curve would be straightened out to 2 or 3 straight lines. I wonder if that has any relation to the longer latency for inking

Edited 7/9/2019: inking has improved considerably now, the aforementioned issues with lag and straightening issue seems to have resolved. Also they’ve added a presentation mode again. Going from 4 to 5 stars!",0

We need to import all documents one by one instead of importing as a bundle of documents. Goodnotes 4 is far more better than this version. Please refund.

There is a bug. Please fix it. While importing, I dragged and dropped a pdf file and then clicked the cancel at the upper right corner. The file was then put into the folder. When I did the same thing again for another file, the original folder was suddenly emptied. I then clicked another cloud. The same folder was shown with nothing. This is weird. This meant the original folder was hanging and frozen in the same spot.

I finally figured out there was a way to import multiple documents at the same time but it turned out that if I imported more than 5 pdfs at the same time, only few of them were imported. In my case, I imported 16 pdfs. But only 4 pdfs were imported. If I lowered the number of pdfs imported, for example, 6 pdfs, 4 of them were imported and two pdfs couldn’t be imported.

1) Writing becomes laggy when used for 1 - 2 hours. Same thing never happen in version 4. The probably due to some memory leaks or resource leaks. Reopen the app can fix the problem, but annoying
2) Occasionally, the writing or erasing effective for a second but somehow undo itself. This is another annoying bug as I have to rewrite the same thing again, and pretty bad when I was trying to capture note in classes. Such a disturb draws my attention out from the class, and impacts my learning actually. 
3) I think this is same issue as #2, but has more disturbs so that i have to split it out. the issue is the erase operation seems to be effective for more than a minute, but somehow it reminded occasionally, although this is quite rare (around once a week for 4 hours a day usage), it is super annoying, as i have erase the writing, and already written new content on it. A minute later, when the erased content reappear, it overlapped with my new content. I cannot do anything on this, as redo doesn’t help, and i have no way to erase the old content, but only erasing both new and old altogether. 
4) I am not sure this is GoodNotes 5 problem itself, but I haven’t experienced this with version 4.  It is somehow after long hours usage of version 5, may be 3-4 hours, the whole iOS occasionally has touch unresponsive issue. Even restarted the app, the issue persists. Only workaround is to restart the whole iPad. This could be iOS issue, but to me it is quite clear that it happens only after i switched to version 5. 

Now I cannot get rid of Version 5, since my new contents all saved in version 5 and has no way to move back to version 4. (Please enable this feature if possible). 

Please help to fix these issues, as version 4 is a really good app. I wish i can stick with version 5.

However it still seems like this can be buggy at times, and I think that there needs to be the option of a smaller more condensed toolbar alongside this one.

2. The update is so laggy, writing is not as smooth as the old version, there is about 1second delay between the screen touching by Apple Pencil and the actual formation of writings. 

3. Sometimes the eraser function is bugged, writings cannot be erased effectively, lines still pop up once they are removed.

4.  The app always quit by itself unexpectedly once I use the text function, it really annoys me as it quits every time I finish my text box.

5.  The loading of notes is very slow, it often takes around 7-8 seconds to update the entire page’s writings. It is really time consuming and causes annoyance when I have to take my notes in a hurry.

Anyway it is still a good note-taking app but there is a lot of room for improvements. Hope your team can fix the ‘laggy’ issue  in time as this troubles me a lot.",0

But very lagging in opening doc & file annotation, with sometimes crash

Some functions were removed such as google drive sync

It is better to fix the bug and add back the features that existing in old version

3659173827,Automatic Backup Function is missing?,Manton_lam,https://itunes.apple.com/hk/reviews/id43744725,5.0.1,4,"I am happy with this update. 
-More stylus options, love the fountain pen.
-the searching system runs perfectly.
-beautiful interface with simplicity.

Some recommendations/questions:
-can I still backup to google drive automatically?(this is important)
-my notes will be much fruitful if “Pencil stylus” can be provided.
-in-app split-view. Most the time, I need to refer 2 pdfs at the same time. It would be nice if I can open 2 notes at the same time with Goodnotes5.

Thank you for the teams’ hard work!",0
