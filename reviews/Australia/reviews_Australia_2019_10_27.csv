There is no longer support for connecting to one drive - but this doesn’t really matter as there is drag and drop which works easily.
The new folder system is something I always thought GoodNotes 4 needed.
I can be taking a note or drawing a diagram in my daily notebook and can easily drag a single page and drop it into other apps (mainly One Drive and PDF Expert)
One thing that appears missing.....AUTOMATIC BACKUP!!
Where has it gone, can you bring it back, the is only Backup Now.

**EDIT**
Coming from using GoodNotes 4, there is definitely some items lacking, where is the pen size slider in the customisable colour, its gone, the autobackup is gone, the eraser sometimes does not fully erase or an erased line rerappears.
And i think the palm rejection is not as rock solid as the previous version. I have both versions running side by side to compare. Though it definitely is much more polished than the previous version. Just not sure why these features have gone missing.

**EDIT**
When is AUTO BACKUP being reinstated. I am kicking myself...had an iPAD crash had to reset and lost a month or so   of notes. My bad!!! GoodNotes 4 had it.
Still a good app.

**EDIT**
AUTO BACKUP to OneDrive please!!!!

1. Annotating a pdf, and you copy and paste a quote but it’s taken a picture of the text so I need to retype it. doh.

2. Drawing a basic diagram, there are no “snap” points for things like circles - it looks annoyingly wonky to have a perfect circle and perfectly straight lines, but not pass through the centre - it’s something that does look wrong with wonky hand drawn circles and wobbly lines, but does with perfect shapes.

Examples are, lack of cloud backup (e.g. Dropbox), small size thumbnails that are hard to read (GN4 has bigger thumbnails that are just the right size), Navigation - “Go To Last Page” and “Go Back” are also missing from GN5. 
Once you find a document using the search feature (which is very powerful), the information field that shows the document location is too narrow, vital information is chopped off the right hand side.  
There are several other items that I can’t remember right now.

4788869803,Not yet a replacement for GN4 Even After 6 Months of Release,Abhijeet Anand,https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id42268724,5.2.3,1,"As few others have mentioned already, this is not quite a replacement for Good Notes 4 yet. It's becoming more and more unfathomable these days, that why do developers insist on removing well used features with each new update. One wonders. Feature in question is of course the variety of backup options that were there in GN4 and the fact that you could connect to other cloud providers. Even if you rewrite your codebase, you can still use your existing code. Yes there are some new features that are welcomed and an obvious improvement but those do not outweigh the lack of existing features.

It’s now more than 6 months since release and yet there are features from GN4 still not available on GN5. Empty promises at best.",0
4788833132,Faster! Less intuitive than v4 though,LogiPlant (R),https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id191328220,5.2.3,3,"I use this app every day for work. 
My job is to assess hundreds of defects a month in an industrial processing plant. 
The main 2x ways I use this app are as follows;
1. Take photos of area/equipment defects and drawing on images for scoping repair work - passing these on as a guide for technicians to complete work. 
2. Create/Mark-up engineering drawings for materials/fabrication quote requests or to show defect rectification requirements (current drawings, new drawings or modification to existing drawings)

In general this app is SO USEFUL in fact, that using it has become THE core function of my role.
I do not remember the last work day where I spent less than 2-4 hours using this app.

This is only a short list of the main points I’ve found with v5 compared to v4....

Pro’s 
Definitely a faster program than v4;
- Multi layer PDF’s load much faster
- complex sketches edit without as less lag than v4
- Quick access 3x pen colour pre-selects are great when switching between layers on sketches
- Ability to rub out just highlighted areas great 
- Ability to remain in photo or image ‘insert’ mode makes it easier to take/import multiple images - but this has disadvantages (see cons below) with selecting objects

Con’s (comparing to v4)
Less intuitive than 4 in switching between functions;
- does not revert back to straight lines when switching back to pen
- does not recognise when using the pen user wants to circle/grab objects when not in pen/rubber mode - have to select lasso each time 
Clunky selection of new page size/type
- have to go to settings to change instead of just being prompted with the last style added
Clunky naming/renaming/copying of files;
- cannot just tap tab name to begin renaming
- copy/paste files is more steps involved than in v4
- folder/file organiser - order folder by name and file in folder by date in V4 not carried across, have to manually change order each time

To sum up, currently I often think ‘this would be so much easier to switch back to v4 to do’.
I am hopeful we will see some improvements in the future updates  where the various extra steps that seem to have been added since v4 are removed from this new version of the app",0
4767269297,Love the all,Moe Kamel,https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id344292603,5.2.3,5,"Best app for note taking .... period.
I have been using for as long as I can remember, when it was still showing shelves and stuff :)

Anyway, I am hoping the Catalina Mac version will be really better and stable than the current GN5 for Mac, as below are my notes I hope to be fixed:

- When the app window is closed while the app still running and reopen, it doesn’t maintain the size of the window (Scale) or last folder/location used.

- Not Manu setting can be tweaked from the Mac desktop version in Preferences

Finally, a feature I would like to see is the ability to password/Face ID lock a document.

Given the fact that more and more people use it, the need for protecting documents and notes is essential now.

Thanks for all the hard work and this great product",0

I am aware that these functions may be useful to some people so having that option to choose what to keep or remove from the toolbar would be AMAZING and would definitely improve the user experience :) 

Notability also has this really cool split screen between notes function which I think is super useful when you want to have the questions / notes / PDF on one side and your answers on the other.

4618769624,Buggy compared to Goodnotes 4,Est_g,https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id6879286,5.1.7,3,"Using the latest version of goodnotes 5.1.6.  This is still my favorite note taking app, but I have to say that Goodnotes 5 seems so buggy compared to Goodnotes 4.  

Main concerns: 
A) when tapping the ""+"" symbol to add a new page, it doesn't matter whether you have ""before"" or ""after"" selected as the insert point, Goodnotes will often randomly choose whether to insert a page before or after your current page.   

B) When choosing text color, the app will always default back to black when you reselect the text tool, no matter what color you had selected before.  This is unlike the other tools where you will always return to the last color selected when you reselect the tool.  This is pretty obstructive to my workflow as I usually have to annotate pdfs that are in black text - so the annotations always have to be in a different color.  Also, to get non- black text, you have to tap the buttons in a very specific order, or black will be automatically selected anyway.  For example to get red, you have to (i) tap the text tool, after first having another tool selected, (ii) tap the red color swatch, (iii) immediately tap in the main document and start typing.  If you do anything else, or a different order, the text will be black, which is absolutely maddening.  It doesn't matter if all your color swatches are red, they will get changed back to default red/blue/black, and black will be selected.  

C) Not a bug, but I note that Goodnotes doesn't accept any bluetooth stylus besides apple pencil/ logitech crayon now.  

Also, I'm putting this in as a review comment as it's also not clear where you can submit bugs on the Goodnotes support page.",0

Templates are nice and simple, though It would be great if you could make your own templates that include a picture. I have to manually add a graph picture in each page to sketch graphs. It would be great it the app had an option to add it automatically or become a new template. App saves the size of the picture so it’s the same size on each page which is nice.

4301266723,best app in this class of apps i’ve ever used,drcolekat,https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id203021488,5.1.1,5,"i use this app all the time. it’s transformed how i work (teaching and research in higher education), basically. reading and annotating articles, and then the hand writing recognition means i can search my own annotations... it’s become my most indispensable tool in academic research. can’t remember who wrote that article you need to cite? but you can remember some of your own comments you wrote in the margins? not a problem, you just do a global search for the keywords you know you jotted down while in the app, and it shows you all the hits! so so so nice and simple and intuitive, i love it!

in teaching, i hook it up to the projector and guide my students through the work in real time. they learn so much better when they see all the work being created in real time in front of them, their own comments appearing on there if i write them on there too... thus, rather than doing boring powerpoint karaoke, this lets the classes flow naturally with the direction of the students’ inquiry, and at the end i export the annotated pdf file and share it with the class, so they all have a copy of all the lecture notes without you needing to do additional work transcribing, and they relate to it better because their thoughts are scaffolded on those notes and scribbles and drawings. pedagogically so much more effecting. and if you want to guide them through a close reading of an article, again so simple with connection to a projector.

providing feedback on students’ work when grading assignments is also so much faster and more effective when you can actually write your comments directly onto their pdf submissions, and if necessary draw something to convey the feedback better, or paste in an image. then you export the pdf to any of a number of cloud based services, or email the students directly. couldn’t be simpler! much faster and better grading experience that is pedagogically superior to adding those horrible annotations in little post-it style notes that other apps used in the higher ed sector use. or having to write an essay to recap what you’d have said in your scribbles on theor submissions.

if you teach, do yourself and your students a favour and just buy this app. it’s been a game-changer in my teaching, and your students will love you for it too, as well as learn better.

apart from that, it’s also awesome to create simple graphics to quickly copy-paste into documents (allows exporting in image formats, not just pdf), taking notes in meetings or conferences and then you can share them directly with your colleagues without the drudgery of re-typing it. i save literally hours by not having to re-type and wordsmith constantly.

i also use it for signing forms, importing and drawing on photos and exporting and sending the annotated pikkie. superb for making silly bespoke postcards and things. lots and lots and lots of uses.

this is simply the best app i’ve ever used in this class of apps, and i’ve tried at least a dozen others, but i just never use those others any more. and the developer regularly adds features, makes it better and easier and more powerful, and if a bug creeps in they are responsive and quickly fix any problems.

lastly, because you can use iCloud to share your library of annotated documents, it means it syncs with your iPhone so those documents are available to you on your phone too.

if you’re hesitating about whether to buy, then stop hesitating and just get it. seriously, it’s one of my top three apps ever, and i reckon you’ll love it too.

thanks for such a terrific product! :)",0

I researched apps based on my needs, then dabbled with GoodNotes 4, but felt it wasn’t quite there. The improvements in 5 did the trick for me. And the iPad Pro mated with the Gen 2 Apple Pencil have ticked the technology boxes for me. 

The end result is that I’m now a convert - and have done away with paper notes!

A couple minor enhancements I’d like to see:
1 - the ability to move a page from one notebook to another (rather than copy, paste and delete)
2 - the ability to “archive” a page when done with it, with an option to either grey it out or hide it from view.",0

You can no longer chose where your back ups go (iCloud forced) so I can't share my pdf version of notes from a shared folder with a Windows user easily.

1. Let us have the ability to customise what our “folders” look like because they are just an ugly, plain, light blue. Id like to colour code mine.
2. Maybe have more pen options (more than ball point, brush and fountain) 
3. More Notebook covers!!!!!! Maybe customisable ones.
4. In lasso mode, when circling writing, let us have the ability to zoom or zoom out once we have lasso’d it. I always have the problem that my handwriting sometimes gets bigger down the page, i wish i could lasso it and decrease the size by zooming out (like a picture).

3898774631,Convenient and is used everyday,Mindset Goals,https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id433598517,5.0.22,4,"Bugs: I’m currently having problems where using the undo button not only reverses what I want, but also the markings I made a few steps prior. I have to refresh the app every time this occurs, and it’s only getting more and more frequent. More of an inconvenience then anything but it’d be nice to get this fixed. 

Review: I bought this app to use on my newly bought Ipad 2018 since the combination of Apple Files, Microsoft OneNote, and another pdf annotating app just wasn’t cutting it. This app provided everything I needed in one app, and other functions I never thought I needed. I can separate large pdf files into smaller ones easily which is more convenient then bookmarking multiple the pages i need to go to, or endlessly scrolling through pages to find the chapter I need like I always had on Files. The Onenote app provides an expanding canvas to write notes and draw diagrams on but I realised that I missed easier organisation on a page and so Goodnotes was a better alternative. 

The only major drawbacks I can think of is that there is no option for split view within the app which would be easier then using two apps separately. Also, you have to manually back up your files which I do to Google Drive - this takes a long amount of time and is a little annoying. I can’t backup to iCloud because after years of using apple products, I’ve filled up the space with other important files. 

Other things: navigation would be much easier if we could organise by file types (folders in one section, notebooks afterwards, etc). Also, for some reason, my auto-capitalisation doesn’t work when naming notebooks and folders. Just a slight hindrance.",0

Had no bad experiences, maybe would be good if you can make it work together with Samsung products as well and not just Apple. 

This was you get broader aspects of good notes overall. Not that I am being biased but I bought my new iPad same time last year as well.

The reason I give 4 stars and not five. Maybe five once you update the app if I am using the lasso tool to move around my notes, why am I not able to move to next page without copy pasting and rather just dragging it. 

For example during vertical scrolling, I wanted to move my notes from page 4 to page 3 and I wasn’t able to move it directly but had to copy paste and that took me too long. Maybe, if the developers can create such a function then it would be great and would allow short amount of time between writing, moving my writing and writing once again.

Thankyou! 

A request though, two shortcuts, an undo feature, 3 finger tap, or something, but most importantly, a shortcut to hide the ui, but keep whatever tool you’re using, it really takes away the aesthetics of what you’re doing, and an unnecessary amount of the screen dedicated to the ui, if ppl don’t like that, they can turn it off in the settings or something, other apps have had this feature for years. I don’t mean to be rude but It really shouldn’t be that difficult to implement. If someone is just taking notes, then they don’t need the ui, generally speaking, if they make a mistake then they can press an undo shortcut saves alot of time, or when you’ve finished a page and you just want to finalize things, you could grab the lasso tool, again, the ui wouldn’t be necessary 90 % of the time. Please add this feature!

Also, great that you’s have added other fonts, As I have hundreds on my Ipad, very useful , maybe add presets for fonts, similar to the 3 different sizes for pens etc, so you could save a font, size and color to a preset, would be a good addition. 

Please keep the layering system as it is now, which I mentioned in my first paragraph, like it is in G4, was unusable for me and my purposes when you’s did that, Thanks. I’ll give 5 stars if you’s add those shortcuts for sure, I’d pay triple the price for that feature alone!",0

Love all the new customisable features I can change now like the pen and highlighter size and the addition of the brush pen and how easy it is to import pictures from the camera roll.

- Not loving the new shapes feature. In good notes 4 I could just roughly draw a square and it would snap into shape. Now I have actually make sure i draw it quite accurately or else I’ll end up with an odd shape. Also, I hope you bring back the ability to draw shapes with the highlighter.

- Lately I’ve had a lot of issues where the eraser wouldn’t work properly and today it has kept crashing when I try and copy and paste things after using the lasso tool. Which is a feature I use the most and has almost made the app unusable for me.

3718614903,Heading in the right direction but starting out a bit buggy,kmcl11,https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id472757762,5.0.7,3,"Pros:
• Can now rotate selections
• New brush type
• Importing images is much easier
• Can add page templates direct from device, not just a drive
• Colour and thickness pre-sets available
• New colour wheel (definitely my favourite update)
• I like that there is the option to automatically colour fill shapes with the new draw shape tool

Cons:
• Intermittent random lag (enough that sometimes I go back and use GoodNotes 4 out of frustration). Even without the random lag that must be some sort of bug, the writing is not nearly as smooth as it was in version 4 which is disappointing as that was one of the best features.
• Sometimes when you erase something, it ignores you and pops back up. Can take many tries to get it to erase properly.
• Sometimes the last thing that you drew disappears for no apparent reason
• No more automatic drive backup! This was a very comforting feature to be able to backup to google drive automatically and I miss it a lot.
• Should be able to rotate selections by degrees as well as by drag so it can be precise
o It is also virtually impossible to rotate without resizing at the same time
• The new brush pen would be much better with transparency (and size) sliders
o All brushers should have a transparency option, possibly as part of the colour picker
• The new template process is less intuitive than the old one
• the colour fill for the draw shape tool should have its own colour (and transparency) picker so that you can have a shape with a different colour for the fill and the outline
• pricing was confusing – still not 100% sure if it was a free upgrade from version 4, or a discounted upgrade (will have to check my statement to be sure)

Notes:
• the ballpoint and fountain pens (especially fountain) seema little different to the ones in GoodNotes 4
• the size/pen thickness picker uses a different scale, so it is a bit hard to get it set the way you used to have it
• should be able to flip sections horizontally or vertically as well as rotate them
• would really LOVE a ‘pencil’ to be the next pen added
• it downloads as a standalone app, not an upgrade to GoodNotes 4
o there is an option to easily import your notes from 4

Conclusion:
GoodNotes 5 is heading in a good direction, but it feels a little unpolished to be released already… Hopefully some updates will fix the actual bugs like lag and malfunctioning erasers, but some other functions should have been thought about as customer experiences, especially the rotation. 
Also, if I have to pay for every new version, I would like them to be a little bigger changes, and a little less buggy.",0

Loved the seamless integration with OneDrive on my desktop and the speed at which you could flick around and between hi res detailed drawings.
Unfortunately both of these features are now lost, exporting to one drive is now cumbersome requiring jumping between apps and the lag when moving around documents is almost unusable...
This is a shame as it is a great workflow tool that I have personally recommended to many peers.",0

3676645810,Worthwhile upgrade,kate?,https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id37662008,5.0.3,4,"The good: new features added like continuous scroll (yay!), easier interface in terms of swapping pens, colours, etc. and I like the folders.

The bad: slower, especially when loading pdf’s, had a couple of instances of text disappearing (only just-written letters and things, no huge amounts of text), and random file swapping mid-way through writing. 

Overall, if these bugs get ironed out in time I think the key features that might’ve set Notability higher than GoodNotes would have been addressed and it seems GoodNotes has it all now",0

3670096896,Undo and redo shortcuts please!,cwa98,https://itunes.apple.com/au/reviews/id908407704,5.0.2,4,The new update brings some fantastic new features that have been requested for a long time however it would be wonderful if there were a future update adding a two finger tap shortcut (or something similar) for the undo (and redo) button similar to procreates implementation. It may not sound like much but I’m sure anybody who has used procreate can vouch that the feature saves SO much time and effort.

I use the auto-backup function to save a copy of everything I write as a PDF on Dropbox. That way I can always access the most recent version of my documents through any phone or web browser in a format readable on any device. Since that function has disappeared in Good Notes 5, I will not be migrating, since that would restrict me to accessing backups only on iOS devices that have goodnotes installed... what a pain! I know I can still export individual PDF files to Dropbox, but it has to be done manually after every single time you change something... no thanks!",2

The long-awaited GoodNotes 5 has brought with it some amazing, highly-desired, new features that really improve the functionality of this app.

But one thing I really want to give feedback on is the writing experience - which has decreased dramatically from GoodNotes 4. 

It’s so unfortunate, but somehow with GoodNotes 5 the time lag between the Apple Pencil and the output on the screen is far, far, FAR more noticeable than it was in GoodNotes 4. Something about writing in the app now feels slow, clunky and does not take full advantage of the capabilities of the Apple Pencil!

Where GN4 was highly comparable to Notability (which I consider to have the best writing experience out of all note-taking apps), GN5 feels like I’m writing on an outdated tablet from 5-7 years ago.

I’m sad because apart from this I LOVE GN5! Please just return to whatever algorithm GN4 was using for writing, and then GN5 will claim its rightful place as my Number 1 note-taking app!",1

One thing I am a little puzzled by, is the three pen thicknesses go from very thin, to thick to very thick. I feel like there is a step missing in between very thin to thin to kinda thick and so on. Especially at the thinner end of the scale. Would love to see that tweaked in a future version.

Otherwise, outstanding work!",0

Performance is now so much better, and rendering is super fast. It feels a lot more fluid and user friendly.

Only one major issue is that the backup to Google drive option in the menu is missing. There is a backup now button but no option to choose the destination cloud service. So I’m not sure where the backup files are being stored?
