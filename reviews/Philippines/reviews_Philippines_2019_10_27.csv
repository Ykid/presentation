Even with high sensitivity it still does not reject my palm writing down. I never notice this problem whenever I am using Notability. Also, there are plenty of times wherein the app would just stop functioning like. I often experience not being able to write or highlight on a document for some weird reason and the only way to fix the problem is to close and re-open the app. It‚Äôs these mildly infuriating moments wherein I would prefer using notability over this app. The only real reason why I am still using this app is because of its highlighting feature wherein it highlights behind the words. As of now, it‚Äôs two stars. The team needs to make more improvements to this app.",1

4804674795,ONE of the BEST notetaking app for a med student BUT..,ML Lover BEFORE,https://itunes.apple.com/ph/reviews/id543167469,5.2.3,4,"From 3 star, I changed my rating to 4 star like what I promised since you guys seems to listen to all your users‚Äô suggestions and tried your very best to adjust and answer all the queries. NOW, why I can‚Äôt give a fully 5 star rating yet? Here‚Äôs why:

1. I‚Äôm solely dependent on your app ever since I became a paperless student. Imagine all of my ebooks, notes, EVERY ESSENTIAL NOTES was on this app and I couldn‚Äôt ask for more because you almost gave all the convenience using this app over the other apps I‚Äôve tried before BUT one of the problem I still encounter ever since I‚Äôm using this app was whenever I import files from other apps or via airdrop going directly to Goodnotes app, there are still cases of LAG or it stops working suddenly and worse, needed to close and reopen the app just to load the file. (Just so you know, I‚Äôm using ipad pro 2 with 512gb and as we all know, apple products don‚Äôt usually have lagging problem :)

2. I‚Äôm really hoping that there will come a time you will offer opening of 2 tabs at the same time. Imagine if we could use 1 tab for ebooks and another 1 tab for other supplemental notes? That will be PERFECTION for every paperless student. PLEASE. (Some might say I should use my 2-tab option on ipad pro, yeah, I‚Äôm already using it for video purposes of what I‚Äôm studying or other supplemental notes as well)

3. Whenever my ipad pro is connected to internet while I‚Äôm using the app, something will pop out in the middle and NOTIFIES EVERY MINUTE something like ‚ÄúNOT ENOUGH ICLOUD STORAGE‚Äù and I already bought additional storage just for that. But due to my succeeding large files, it then started to appear again after few weeks. Is there any way or option to remove that notification? It was REALLY ANNOYING because it pops out whenever I study. 

4. I also wish to have the option to choose for THUMBNAIL SIZE? I mean, there are files sometimes from ppt to pdf, then whenever I import it on Goodnotes app, the thumbnail is so big that EVEN using the BIGGEST SIZE FOR HIGHLIGHTER COULDN‚ÄôT ACCOMMODATE the words I was trying to highlight.

5. I‚Äôm again asking also if you can add a tool for FOOTNOTES or sticky notes. That will be really A BIG HELP. 

6. If it‚Äôs possible to have a RECORD as an additional TOOL, that will be nice as well but if you can‚Äôt still offer that, still fine anyways. 

As promised like before, I‚Äôll change my review if you guys would really help us all students. Please. THIS APP WAS SUCH A GREAT APP, AND MY ONLY HOPE IS FOR YOU TO BE THE BEST APP.",0

Since GN already has my money anyway, here‚Äôs my mere two wishes for the next major upgrade. 
1. I wish ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù become extremely specific: eg. Fixed bug that randomly and often draws additional lines when handwriting (that also existed in 2017 when I first bought the app, which now I remember is why I uninstalled GN in the first place).
2. I also wish these bugs would be on a roadmap that‚Äôs publicly available for the world to see, so the dev team can at least have accountability and dates they‚Äôre chasing.

I‚Äôm a big fan of Goodnotes 4 and will probably continue to use it until there‚Äôs no support for it. I excitedly upgraded to Goodnotes 5 but was very disappointed. Some comments:

1. Goodnotes 5 lacks response / is quite slow. I‚Äôm using a first generation iPad pro 12.9 in. I would think that my device should still have decent power to run this app smoothly. Some of my writing seems to momentarily disappear. 

2. When looking for a particular notebook, I‚Äôd prefer that the thumbnails / coverage page (if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre called) be bigger... just like in Goodnotes 4. Or at least have the option to make them bigger.

3. I‚Äôm very particular about the preset font colors from Goodnotes 4. I couldn‚Äôt match the exact green and red that I was previously using. I get it that I should be able to use the hex codes, etc to get the exact color, but couldn‚Äôt Goodnotes just match Goodnotes 5 with Goodnotes 4?

4. I‚Äôm also very particular about my pen size. In Goodnotes 4, I used 2.7 which is like a 0.6 equivalent in Goodnotes 5. I just wish they were exactly the same so I wouldn‚Äôt have to guess the ‚Äúconversion‚Äù. 

5. Some templates from Goodnotes 4 are no longer available on Goodnotes 5. Sure, I could just import them from Goodnotes 4, but I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have to. The upgrade should make things easier... not more difficult.

6. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I had a quick discussion with my colleageus and we all felt the UI/UX of Goodnotes 4 was simple, intuitive, and got the job done for us. Goodnotes 5 incorporates changes that may not be bad, but they‚Äôre not necessarily better. We almost feel like the change was for the sake of change.

To the developers of Goodnotes, like I previously said, I‚Äôm a big fan. But please, get Goodnotes 5 right before you stop supporting Goodnotes 4. Many of the new features incorporated could have just been done on Goodnotes 4 (like that filing system, global search, etc). I‚Äôm sure the more I use it, the more comments I will have.

Requesting for:
- side by side notes (priority) 
- sticky notes (can rotate)
- gifs

This would be miles ahead of the game if you could add these features.

The dashboard and templates won me over. You guys listened. So please, hopefully you get those features soon!",0
