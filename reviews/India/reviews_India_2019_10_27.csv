4896669892,Not fluid and natural to writing,Ajhavery,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id1056143912,5.3.3,1,"Step 1: Beware, there‚Äôs no refund if you don‚Äôt like the app after buying. I raised a refund request after 2-3 hours and it was denied.
Review: I‚Äôve used GoodNotes 5 and notability both, an area where goodnotes shines is highlighting and paper templates.
However, addition of a lot of customisation and making their flow non coherent hinders in the user experience.
First, the 3 line bar at the top  - document header, tab, then tools, take a lot of space and leave less as writing space.
Two, to access another document, there should be a quick access swipe from left like notability.
Third, if you change paper template, paper size changes. This requires a lot of adjustments then using lasso tool and resizing the text which is a huge pain in a big note.
Also, you need to change paper template on a per page basis. Applying a template to all pages isn‚Äôt intuitive.
Fourth, the line height or grid size in paper template isn‚Äôt equivalent to paper notebooks, offering four grid sizes to choose from as a separate option from choosing page size and colour is a must.
Fifth, offering a square or rectangle lasso tool preset is welcome as it help to cover a big block conveniently.
Sixth, once a picture is put in place reorienting it within the document should be as easy as a pencil click, the current method of selecting the area through lasso tool just makes way too many steps to execute simple tasks.

There‚Äôs a lot more which I would see as basic features in my note taking app of choice but isn‚Äôt there. Hope goodnotes focuses on user experience rather than just features addition to make writing experience a breeze.",0

On zooming, letters takes time to look what they suppose to be looked especially if document size is getting bigger in one session upon which i have to exit app from multitasking and reopen app. I think it is because of undo feature which keeps getting bigger with writing hence reopening frees up that memory. Anyway goodnotes team with every update please always optimise rendering of documents specially when it is getting bigger with writing because it is at its core a writing app and if rendering is slow meaning whole purpose of note taking is failing to serve its purpose.

3662985258,Beautiful upgrade for free!,The_Dharmik,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id474163912,5.0.2,5,"Goodnotes 5 has provided almost everything I was missing in Goodnotes 4. The upgrade is free and that‚Äôs so generous of you.  Upgrade brings excellent writing experience just like pen and paper! New UI is also very interacting. 

Two things still missing - locking feature for notes and recording while writing.",1
3661836357,Auto backup is missing,Mukhlis94,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id944788615,5.0.1,4,"The main reason for giving 2 stars is that auto backup is missing. Earlier it would automatically backup as pdf to google drive and you access your notes from anywhere.

Otherwise features are good.",0
3661556228,Kudos to the developers,akki0011,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id768074931,5.0.1,5,"I haven't gotten yet to try this new version but I am already giving it 5 stars just because I was able to upgrade from goodnotes 4 without paying anything. That is so refreshing especially in this day and age when everyone just wants to make more money. More karma and well-wishes to the app team out there.
I already liked goodnotes 4, so I'm sure this version would be great as well.",0

3660169699,I just miss one thing,Sudeep Pandey,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id925471233,5.0.1,4,"I don‚Äôt find an option to hide the title bar and have access of writing page over whole screen. And, this new awesome design of good notes 5 is great. Added features makes it more versatile. More importantly it feels more intuitive than before. A big thanks to developers for making upgrade free. It takes a lot of effort to make an app like this and I really respect your efforts towards us.",0
3659620581,Very good upgradeüëçüèª,Prabz273,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id388395622,5.0.1,3,Thank for the wonderful upgrade. Far better than previous version. Nice interface. It would be fine if you enable to import the templates created in the previous version. Possibility of two notebooks opened side by side for comparing and copying contents from one to the other would me more useful.,0
3659487778,Feels like new and more powerful,Raghav Katyal,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id383484194,5.0.1,5,"Things I love,
I really like the new interface its much more pleasing to customise things around. There so many beautiful cover and page templates to choose from. Organising folders, notebooks, notes, pdfs images whatever you want in your folders. Separate tab to search text or handwritten notes everywhere.
Also new little tweaks added which were not available in GN4 like your handwriting resizes according to the page size. 

Things I need,
Only thing missing for me are the view features like 100% zoom.",0
3659386292,Simplicity missing.,Manoj Jogia,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id85646693,5.0.1,1,"Namaskar 
I had underestimated apple note. Recently I saw a you tube video and started to use apple note. I use apple note with my Apple Pencil on my new iPad Pro it‚Äôs awesome. What I love is access from the screen lock and you can rename note by just pulling it. It‚Äôs so simple. Good note 5 and 4 both are not user friendly.What we don‚Äôt require is there, what we require is missing. What is important is how fast without friction you do your work. Here it‚Äôs missing. You have made it too complicated. In terms esteem value your good note looks fine. Not in terms of functionality. 
Dhanyavad.
