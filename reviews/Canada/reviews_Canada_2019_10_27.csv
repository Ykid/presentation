4967595999,So many bugs. Goodnotes 4 is much more reliable.,Aramulia,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id122753439,5.3.6,2,"I’ve been using Goodnotes 5 now (upgraded from Goodnotes 4) for two months so that I could properly give it a trial. I made the switch because I’ve been dreaming of vertical scrolling for years. What I’ve noticed is that they seem to have fully rewritten the app rather than adding more features to Goodnotes 4. But they did it so hastily that they’ve left tons of bugs in the UI. Just a couple examples:
- overlapping elements when my keyboard is displayed so that I can’t select certain things (e.g. colours from the colour palette)
- custom text colours revert back to the default after 1 use
- not being able to use blue text colours until I click the red one first
.... and the list goes on.

I’ve waited years for Goodnotes 5 to come out, and with that substantial time as well as the time spent in beta, I expected a higher quality product.

Initially I was optimistic that updates would come out to fix these bugs, but the app has been out for 10 months now and updates are scarce and haven’t been addressing bugs. I really think Goodnotes 5 needs to take a break from adding more features and instead work on improving the quality of its existing ones.",0

4956564758,Honest Suggestions from a Real Student,Mooshoo Man Mild,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id220357409,5.3.6,4,"Hello,

I'm in love with this app, it is great for writing notes being a student at the University of Waterloo. However, being a student, I do have some suggestions that would make notetaking way better on this app.

1. Ability to customize the toolbar: Having more than one tool available at once. For example, having more than 3 colours available at the top would be great. An ability to just drag and drop your frequently used colours into the main toolbar so you don't have to go into the colour section every time you need to switch. The same can be done with pens. 

2. Graphing and Shape insertion: I like the ability to draw and it automatically decide the shape. But more often than not, it doesn't get the shape right. I would love a section where I can choose what kinds of shapes I can insert, and just manupulate them with the pencil. Having a set of axis to choose from would be amazing as well, X,Y and X,Y,Z. Things like that to make drawing graphs easier!

3. A ruler! Like the one apple has on their notes app. You can move the ruler on screen and draw straight lines as you wish. Being shaky, its hard to get the straight lines right, so a ruler like apple's would be absolutely game changing. 

Seriously, I'm a student that uses this all the time, and I'd be glad to give you any input on what to fix and add! This is a fantastic application for writing notes, its brilliant! But there are a lot of aspects that I wish were included.

Don't hesitate to get in contact with me, I give honest reviews from a student's perspective. Your app is mostly being sold to students, so why not listen to one first hand? Feel free to contact me, I'd love to give input. I really do love this app.

This makes me not able to use this app as I would like it to. As I am visually impaired and need that feature,0
4948299074,Enjoying it,Harrisob13,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id225994425,5.3.4,4,"The more I work with it the easier it gets although I think my one strong criticism would be the lack of instruction to accomplish common things. Pasting is a command that is invisible until you do just the right thing with the right tool selected (not described in the help files). Anyhow now that I’ve laboriously figured out a number of things, it is enjoyable to use.
The visual aspect of this is Super - definitely it’s winning point.
Update: Now using it for a few days, I am getting intermittent recognition of the Apple Pencil but so far only in my digital planner not in other documents so I have no idea what’s going on.",0

Anyway, can write on anything from word docs to PDFs and it’s own notes. Having a never ending notebook is great. Love how I can pick different colours with a single tap or add photos with ease. I stopped using acrobat since this is way easier for notes on PDFs. Tabs switch between open files for ease

4943280582,Lots more to improve,Kusachtak,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id170273988,5.3.3,2,"Doesn’t transfer files immediately. I have to close the app, restart it and retry pressing “copy to goodnotes” over 4x to 5x. The typing tool in this needs to be heavily improved, very annoying to work with. Sometimes the app completely freezes and won’t let me write anything. The transfer image button in the tab transfers the picture in the lowest possible quality, I have to work around it by adding a picture I took without the toolbar. Why can’t I make different colored folders? There’s much more that this app needs to improve, let’s start by fixing all the bugs this app has (too many).

I was a Notability user for about a year and decided to give GoodNotes a try and I was very happy. The writing experience is much better. The swapping from the eraser back to the pen is great and the organizational structure is phenomenal.

They turnout ugly and misplaced and complete ruins the original document. That really influences my work and would like that issue to be solved.

Listen are there times where my writing is a tad buggy, yes. But it’s only been while using the magnify tool to write neatly. Every time I’ve had the app crash I have lost none of my work, what else could you ask for. The fact that you can search for handwritten words is mind-blowing considering I write in cursive. However, I do think they can do more with this. I’d like to see my notes save to my iCloud in a way where I can access them from my files app. Instead of having to send it to myself.

Definitely has features Notability doesn’t have but there are glitches and bugs that still need to be fixed. The new presentation mode is great but ever since the upgrade, my pages get darker when I’m mirroring. It’s so weird... Please get this fixed!",0
4761171256,Almost perfect...! :),Novecento89,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id42769270,5.2.2,4,"First, the App is VERY GOOD, WELL THOUGHT and WELL DESIGNED. The App is much MORE INTUITIVE than the last version of GoodNotes (ver. 4). You found basically the same features (and more), but everyone of them is much better (e.g. you can now rotate images and notes, the use of the highlighter automatically makes perfect straight lines, you can easily add text in one click, etc.). Like other people, I did notice some bugs with the eraser at the beginning, however with all the updates since then, it works much better now. Considering how well the hand writing in GoodNotes 4 was, I have no doubt that GoodNotes be the best app using the Apple Pencil (or other pencil) again!

HOWEVER, some features, even if they are more intuitive in their way to work, could really be improved. (1) The whole visual appearance of the app looks better, it makes it nice to work with and even easier. But we miss a little bit of work space, even on a 12,9’’ screen. On full screen view, I think it could be a good use of space to merge the toolbar with the menu bar. We have the option to remove the status bar of the iPad, but it is not a good way to save space because, during a lecture for example, you want to know the time and battery %. However, I noticed that we save space while writing because the developers removed the font bar that was directly over the keyboard bar. Good move, but I will discuss it below. Also, (2) even if we can now modify the font of each character that is in the same text box (awesome, thanks!), we cannot change the font for the whole text box as simple as with previous version of GoodNote. You have to select all the text instead of simply selecting the «text box» as in ver. 4. It would be great to have a « double-click » option to select the box, then the text.

It would also be very more intuitive if the Bold/italic/underline buttons were directly on the keyboard bar (like now, great, thanks!), but it misses the font size buttons. Could you please add it? During a lecture, you often have to change the font size because you sometimes have more or less space to write on from one slide to another.

Finally, it would be VERY GREAT and even more intuitive if we could have the option to « automatic deselect » the lasso tool like we can with the eraser.

To conclude, GoodNotes 5 needs a few improvements but for now this is actually a very GREAT start. I LOVE GoodNotes and I use it everyday since many years now. This app is very intuitive, well designed and looks nicer than before. These improvements make it EASIER TO USE (while organizing your files for example). It the last versions, the app gave you (and still does) the opportunity to modify and transform PDF files like no other app, and it has now even more features than before (like searching in your text notes and hand notes for example). GoodNotes 5 is a powerful and productive tool for everyday, and for me, it is the best note app on the store. I use it for everything, whether for school or my personal projet!",0

1. When drawing shapes, rather than having to draw it out, have a feature to enlarge the size without distorting or enlarging the line. Or being able to drag the square or circle into the correct size and space. So often I try to make a square, but unless I make four lines I almost never can get a perfect stroke without it thinking I’ve caved in a side. I’m fine with drawing four sides, but then I can’t use the colour fill. 

2. Allow for easier cursive writing

Areas where Goodnotes beats Notability:

Palm Rejection: I'm left handed, and Notability's layout is not lefty-friendly. They do have a left-handed mode, but their note switcher kept activating when I rested my hand on the left edge of the screen. Goodnotes' palm rejection has more granular settings, and it really shows. For increased reliability, switch off single-finger panning, and you'll never have an issue with palm rejection, ever. In Goodnotes, left-handed accessibilty is baked into the whole UI; in Notability, left-handed accessibility was an afterthought.

Organization: Notebooks, outline pages, nested folders, and quicknotes are all useful and better than Notability's dividers, subjects, and notes system.

Paper Options: There are loads of good templates and the ability to import your own. I was annoyed at Notability's relatively few templates, and I couldn't adjust the line spacing to my liking. If you don't like the line spacing in Goodnotes, just get a different template (or make your own if you're so inclined). Goodnotes also has a pack of extra templates you can get on their website if you search for it.

Tools: Goodnotes has better tools and a more robust toolbar than Notability. Having three preset colours and thicknesses saves a tap every time you want to switch. Also, their eraser auto-deselect saves me from having to double-tap the pencil every time I'm done erasing. It's a really nice creature comfort. Text boxes actually work the way you expect them to in Goodnotes; Notability's text boxes are atrociously difficult to position well on the page.

Areas where Notability beats Goodnotes:

Audio Recording: This is a niche feature that Goodnotes hasn't bothered with, and you probably won't use it, but it'll be really nice if you need it. I could see this being useful in an interview, allowing you to record the interview and also take notes, and have your notes tied with the recording. If you're thinking of using it in lectures, though, you shouldn't do that. Taking notes without the recording is better for reviewing later.

Dark mode: If you absolutely have to have dark mode, go to Notability. Goodnotes' UI is all light, and although they do have dark paper in their bonus template pack, there'll still be white screens all over. Notability has a dark UI and options for grey, navy blue, and black paper.

Verdict: Unless you absolutely need dark mode (for accessibility or something like that) or you think the audio-recording feature is useful to you, go with Goodnotes. It's a better experience in almost every single way.",1

Massive Top Bar, no focus
The top bar is now GIGANTIC. Forget a focus on the document at hand, the UI instead shows you EVERYTHING, ALL THE TIME. Not to mention that “bluejean blue”: yuck. Can’t there be a “focus mode” which hides the UI so I can just write without all this crap at the top?

* Lock-in: it seems the app uses a proprietary undocumented format, so that notes cannot be read without it. Requiring the app to edit notes is fair. Requiring it to read notes is a major drawback.
* limited export: there is no way to include a PDF with the backups, only to manually export to PDF.
* buggy PDF export: the resulting files are exceedingly large.  This seems to be an old issue stemming from using a buggy PDF library (there are many others out there).",0

4150110543,"no real control over the paper, not flexible",Jeremy Bee,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id41418432,5.0.32,2,"The thing that made me purchase this app was the description of the many paper sizes and backgrounds (templates) that ‘mimic real paper’, but the sizes of paper and the paper handling are actually very limited. 

Currently, in real life, I use basic white paper scratch pads of various sizes and a real ink ball pen.  This app can replicate the experience of the pen, but not the notepaper. 

You can choose various sizes of paper, but they are all displayed on the screen in a forced, zoomed view, so they are impossible to tell apart from one another.  You cannot rotate or zoom the paper yourself.  You cannot zoom out into multi-page views.  You cannot reshuffle the pages or move them around.  You cannot have a document with some small and some large pieces of paper in it.  

Worse, since the page is always zoomed in, the perceived sizes of the lines relative to the page *change* even though the page display itself does not, so you never know what size of line you are ‘really’ using or how big that piece of virtual paper ‘really’ is. 

This one feature, (the forced zoom) completely ruins the illusion of writing on real sheets of paper.  If all chosen paper sizes are always going to present the same way, then having paper sizes at all is arguably a waste of time in the first place. If you are using the 11” iPad Pro for instance, every note, of every size, will present like a standard A4 sheet. 

A further annoyance is that there is no way to turn off fingers as an input method even when you’ve selected the Apple Pencil.  So when you don’t happen to have the pencil in your hand, and you touch the paper in the slightest way, you create a mark.  My drawings are thus littered with spots and specks from inadvertent touches.  

What’s needed, is to focus on Pencil support *only* and forget about finger input altogether.  Then add a small set of robust finger gestures for proper and efficient manipulation of the paper.  You know, like in real life?  By trying to do both things, this app fails at either one.  

It seems to be a work in progress so I have hope that these silly interface and UI problems will be fixed in the long run, but for now it’s unusable for me.",0

I’ve adjusted my Apple Pencil setting same as goodnotes 4 , but doesn’t alway behave the same and sometimes doesn’t work. I double check my pencil in goodnotes 4 and works just fine, so it’s not the pencil.

I do like the fact that there are more folder options, but the you only get a couple of views. It feels like an old Linux folder GUI that you can’t really customize. I’d rather prefer the categories method as in good notes 4. It feels a bit more lightweight and I can navigate quicker on any of my devices.

I think there have been other new features in Goodnotes5, but It’s laggy and crashes that I can’t really investigate them, I need to be productive and can’t rely on this product at the moment as I use it for work and educational training. So, Currently its not installed until it’s more stable.

This was perfect in version 4. The new toolbar is prettier, but less functional to me personally.
The toolbar in the zoom window is now missing, it was quite handy in V4. In the zoom window, I would also frequently X away the blue rectangle when I was writing in a narrow column (my planner, for example), and it would stay away until I hit the ""undo"" arrow. Now, the blue rectangle keeps reappearing, and it’s really super annoying when writing in a column and not needing it.
Also, Auto-Backups are definitely missing. Not good.
Like other users here, I will keep using GoodNotes4 until these things have been fixed in V5.
Thanks to the developers for keeping at it and giving their best to improve. This was just not QUITE ready for the release.
EDIT: Thanks to someone else’s review I was made aware of another issue, and that is the new bookmarks feature. In V4, I used the bookmarks like an interactive table of contents. This is now no longer possible. In fact, the new bookmarks view is totally useless to me. Guys, why did you change all those things that weren’t in any need to be fixed?? I don’t get it!

Simply, it’s full of bugs. The eraser does not work properly, the scrolling functionality is not consistent, and scrolling buttons in zoom mode sometime cause the page to turn!

I contacted the developer. They were somehow responsive, but I didn’t get any useful feedback. There’s been a couple of updates, yet they seem to fix nothing and cause more issues!

Also, earlier today, I was trying to insert an “image” of a sticky note that I downloaded from Etsy to write a note on a textbook page. Once I had clicked insert > image > camera roll > selected the picture, it just inserted itself on my textbook as a new page - not on the page I was in. On GoodNotes 4, I was able to insert these sticky notes and other images onto the page I wanted (handwritten notes and PDFs/textbook) and had no issues. 
I am honestly having more trouble with this app. So I think update is in need.

说实话，你要是还没花钱升级呢 
我并不值得升级 good note4 已经非常good use啦哈哈（算是对他们的跨讲）
我升级的主要原因是 不喜欢 4 很迷信，我知道
但我就是不喜欢4 有什么办法呢

不过刚升级之后，要花一段时间来适应新的变化。这段时间，你会觉得真的浪费钱骗了。我当时升级很大一个原因是因为可以像noteability那样竖着滑了。但是这个竖着滑，有时会东倒西歪的左右偏很烦人。没notability的好用。
照相什么的 要双击 也没原来的好用

不过升级之后，用了一个星期。习惯之后还算可以吧，笔的粗细可调？算不算一个有点？

总之，习惯之后感觉还是不错。但是，你要还没升级就真的不建议升级。

Cons: 
- As many of stated, the palm reject is horrible, the eraser is lagging and creates jumps all over the page. Sometimes it never stops jumping so I have to exit the app. This is annoying because I had write all my lecture notes so I miss out on information
- Using the Apple Pencil it sometimes doesn’t recognize that I am writing, but only for a word or two. Writing with the pencil is laggy as well and for whatever reason the page will slightly move a little to the right and make my words blend into each other.
- When I switch from pen to another tool (or vice a versa) it doesn’t automatically switch back to the tool (or pen) I was using before like it use to. This messes me up so bad. 
- No option to record within the app.

Pros:
- It’s a lot prettier and has a lot more customizable options for paper (colour), book covers, etc.
- Scrolling is nice when it works
- It was SO EASY to transfer from the previous edition.
- As far as I can tell so far, we didn’t loose a lot of options in the newer edition. Things have changed such as the highlighter and pens but honestly I do not mind the changes.

Pros:
- Effortless file transfer from GoodNotes 4,
- Paper can be yellow or white,
- Can scroll page to page horizontally or vertically,
- My handwriting somehow looks a bit better than GoodNotes 4,
- Super cute cover templates.

Cons:
- The three pen selections, the eraser, and the undo button on the Zoom tool is no longer there, so if you write a lot with that tool you will have to constantly reach all the way up to change pens, erase, or undo,
- My text would suddenly disappear as I write. This is extremely annoying, especially to cursive writers as you’d have to re-write a whole word,
- In GoodNotes 4, you can erase with your finger, this cannot be done in GoodNotes 5, you have to use the pencil,
- Erasing is always glitchy, 
- The audio recording tool is no longer available.

I’m sure there are many other pros and cons that have already been brought up by others but the above are just what I care for. Overall, in my opinion, GoodNotes 4 is still much better for note-taking as a student, and that GoodNotes 5 is not much of an upgrade.

Pros:

- Looks nicer than Goodnotes 4
- Updated cover designs, and paper templates
- Folders feature allows for better organization
- Easy transfer of notes from Goodnotes 4

Cons:
- Palm rejection feature is not on par with previous version, causes lines to appear out of nowhere and zoom window to move while writing.
- When transferring notes from Goodnotes 4, bookmark labels were kept. However, Goodnotes 5 does not allow the user to label bookmarks and keep a “Table of Contents” of each notebook. 
- App feels slower than previous version, and pen strokes lag. Moving the zoom window down the page often shows blurred sections which was not an issue in Goodnotes 4.
- Unable to easily change pen colours, and undo/redo actions from the zoom window.

The Narrow and Quad ruled grid paper was my favorite to work with, it helped me keep all my notes polished and straight, all without the writing being too large. Additionally, the app is glitching on the home screen and showing up as an additional icon in the recent apps section, and the only way to get rid of it is to restart the iPad.

2.  I love lists (even this comment is in a list form) but there are no bullets, number lists options, etc.  Also super annoying for a note taking app.

However its does lack in some functionality.
- I can’t go back and forth in my typed notes using the arrows on my apple keyboard. It just moves the page around. So i have to manually go to the word and place in the word that needs to be edited. (Maybe a bug? 
- It automatically changes the font sometimes (from bold to regular or to light) 
- Still lacks a function to create tables which I do find quite annoying since you have to make them manually and don’t always know what size you need. 
- Would like to have a recording feature added too.

2. adding pages before or after a page no longer works. The added page goes to the beginning or end and seems to not know where to go 

2b you can’t just use the plus sign function anymore you have to use the arrow at the bottom of the select page, but it doesn’t add pages before or after anyway . Pages just randomly get put at the start or end of the document 

2C. Pasting pages copied from another document is also much more complicated than in the past 

3. Deleting pages in a document takes super long 
4. You can no longer see the page you are on (ie split thumbnail and larger view).  This was a useful function 
5. Importing from Dropbox no longer allows more than 1 document at a time to be imported -  this is the worst.  
6. Apple Pencil has a delay , especially the eraser 

7. Simplicity has been replaced with additional clicks on the done button for example. 

8. No double page viewing with this update

9. No audio recording 

10. The eraser on the Apple Pencil is delayed

3670436261,A worthy competitor to Noteshelf,Academic Pro,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id180684562,5.0.2,4,"Having worked with many stylus-based writing/notetaking apps now, Noteshelf has become my go to application. The recent upgrade and improvements of GoodNotes 5; however, make it a worthy competitor. The writing engine is happily improved and really feels like pen to paper writing with no lag or missteps. The interface to create a notebook and to choose paper is easy to use, but additional paper choices are needed including a legal paper size with wide-ruled lines. Furthermore, it is puzzling that one can type a title for a notebook (which is placed below the notebook) and yet the covers in many cases leave lines or spaces for that title to be handwritten or typed on the cover itself...odd. Perhaps provide a default for the title to appear on the cover? The choice of vertical or horizontal page additions is welcome, but why is it so hard for all these apps to just provide an option for automatic page advance when you reach the bottom of a page? Pen choices are quite good and hopefully even more choices or variations in these will become available. The last point for now is that the shape tool should be more polished. If a circle is drawn it should recognize this and draw a perfect circle. These shapes should all be clonable so that a flowchart can be drawn up quickly rather than trying to draw the same sized shape multiple times. I will keep trying this version out to see how it continues to develop, especially working with pdfs for markup, but it is a very good application at this point in time.",0

I REALLY like the new photo importing method! Way easier to access, and being able to resize the image and rotate it as soon as it's imported feels like what it should've been all along. I love having the small scrollable bar that pops up containing your recent photos - I can see myself using that exclusively and completely ignoring the photos app pop-up menu. I like a lot of the new features, but this and the 3 customizable colour options are easily my favourite.

Audio recording and Split Screen are the two big features that are glaringly missing considering how requested they are.

I bought version 4 last week (!) to compare it with Notability...and it didn’t work for me. Needless to say I was happy to see an upgrade path to version 5, so I tried it again—and unless some glaring fault suddenly appears, I’ve now left Notability behind. Both apps work extremely well and it’ll always come down to personal preference (and if you need audio recording), but GoodNotes 5 fixed the annoyances I had with version 4, such as horizontal-only scrolling and what seemed like much less precise handwriting recognition (with my terrible script anyway). 

I already much preferred the notebook paradigm to Notability’s organization scheme so after spending an evening testing various scenarios I’ve made up my mind. There are literally tons of details I could get into (export, sharing, favourites view etc) but I won’t for the sake of brevity. And as a bonus: I created a notebook with the sole purpose to import Notability PDFs...and the app has properly indexed ALL my handwritten notes. Which means I can search everything I’ve created in Notability within GoodNotes 5. I was sure this would be linked to the internal ink engine but it isn’t. Wow.
